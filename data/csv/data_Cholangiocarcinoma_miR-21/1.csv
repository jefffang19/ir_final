0,MicroRNA-21 and Dicer are dispensable for hepatic stellate cell activation and the development of liver fibrosis.,"Fibrosis and cancer represent two major complications of chronic liver disease. MicroRNAs have been implicated in the development of fibrosis and cancer, thus constituting potential therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated the role of microRNA-21 (miR-21), a microRNA that has been implicated in the development of fibrosis in multiple organs and has also been suggested to act as an ""oncomir."" Accordingly, miR-21 was the microRNA that showed the strongest up-regulation in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) in multiple models of fibrogenesis, with an 8-fold to 24-fold induction compared to quiescent HSCs. However, miR-21 antisense inhibition did not suppress the activation of murine or human HSCs in culture or in liver slices. Moreover, genetic deletion of miR-21 in two independently generated knockout mice or miR-21 antisense inhibition did not alter HSC activation or liver fibrosis in models of toxic and biliary liver injury. Despite a strong up-regulation of miR-21 in injury-associated hepatocellular carcinoma and in cholangiocarcinoma, miR-21 deletion or antisense inhibition did not reduce the development of liver tumors. As inhibition of the most up-regulated microRNA did not affect HSC activation, liver fibrosis, or fibrosis-associated liver cancer, we additionally tested the role of microRNAs in HSCs by HSC-specific Dicer deletion. Although Dicer deletion decreased microRNA expression in HSCs and altered the expression of select genes, it only exerted negligible effects on HSC activation and liver fibrosis. Conclusion: Genetic and pharmacologic manipulation of miR-21 does not inhibit the development of liver fibrosis and liver cancer. Moreover, suppression of microRNA synthesis does not significantly affect HSC phenotype and activation. (Hepatology 2018;67:2414-2429).","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)"
1,"Dihydromyricetin inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promotes apoptosis via regulating miR-21 in Human Cholangiocarcinoma Cells.","Dihydromyricetin, the most abundant natural flavonoid isolated from Ampelopsis grossedentata, exhibits broad anti-tumor effects. However, the effects of dihydromyricetin on cholangiocarcinoma remain unclear. This study examined the anti-tumor effects of dihydromyricetin in two human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines HCCC9810 and TFK-1, and the underlying mechanism was also investigated. Our study was the first to show that dihydromyricetin significantly inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promoted apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells. By analyzing the TCGA dataset, we found that expression of miR-21, an oncogene and a potential target of anticancer drugs for cholangiocarcinoma, was upregulated in cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared to paired control tissues. Moreover, dihydromyricetin significantly reduced the expression of miR-21 in a dose-dependent manner. Overexpression of miR-21 remarkably abolished the inhibitory effects of dihydromyricetin on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and abrogated its effect of promoting cell apoptosis in both HCCC9810 and TFK-1 cells. Dihydromyricetin remarkably increased the expression of PTEN and decreased the expression of phosphorylated Akt, while overexpression of miR-21 abrogated the modulation of PTEN/ Akt pathway by dihydromyricetin. Taken together, our study demonstrates that dihydromyricetin inhibits cell proliferation, migration, invasion and promotes apoptosis in cholangiocarcinoma cells via regulating miR-21.",Journal of Cancer
2,MiR-21 promotes intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma proliferation and growth in vitro and in vivo by targeting PTPN14 and PTEN.,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) constitutes the second-most common primary hepatic malignancy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the pathogenesis of ICC. However, the clinical significance of miR-21 levels in ICC remains unclear. Here, we investigated the role of miR-21 in ICC and found that its expression was significantly upregulated in serum of ICC patients. Serum miR-21 levels robustly distinguished ICC patients from control subjects. Further experiments showed that inhibition of miR-21 suppressed ICC cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Specifically, inhibition of miR-21 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, PTPN14 and PTEN were identified as direct and functional targets of miR-21. Finally, we showed high expression levels of miR-21 were closely related to adverse clinical features, diminished survival, and poor prognosis in ICC patients. This study revealed functional and mechanistic links between miR-21 and tumor suppressor genes, PTPN14 and PTEN, in the pathogenesis of ICC. MiR-21 not only plays important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor growth in ICC, but is also a diagnostic and prognostic marker, and a potential therapeutic target for ICC.",Oncotarget
3,miR-21 and KLF4 jointly augment epithelial-mesenchymal transition via the Akt/ERK1/2 pathway.,"miR-21 induces epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cells. However, the mechanism by which this occurs remains unclear. In the present study, high throughput platform was employed to detect the genes that are differential expressed in QBC939 cells transfected with a hsa-miR-21 antagomir or control vectors. The EMT-related Kr√ºppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) gene was downregulated after miR-21 was knocked down. Overexpression of miR-21 upregulated KLF4, Akt, ERK and mesenchymal cell markers (N-cadherin and vimentin), downregulated the expression of epithelial cell marker E-cadherin and reduced cell migration and invasion. Immunohistochemistry showed that KLF4, pAkt and pERK were upregulated in tumor xenografts transfected with miR-21 mimics. Inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt and ERK1/2 pathways, LY294002 and U0126, significantly suppressed the EMT phenotype. The present data demonstrated that overexpression of miR-21, accompanied with KLF4, augmented the EMT via inactivation of Akt and ERK1/2 pathways. In conclusion, we have identified a novel mechanism that may be targeted in an attempt to relieve the malignant biological behavior of CCA cells.",International journal of oncology
4,Galangin Inhibits Cholangiocarcinoma Cell Growth and Metastasis through Downregulation of MicroRNA-21 Expression.,"Galangin, a natural flavonoid product derived from the root of galangal, is emerging as a promising anticancer agent against multiple cancers. Yet, whether it also has antitumor effects on cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that galangin exhibits multiple antitumor effects on CCA cells including decreases cell viability; inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion; and induces apoptosis. Moreover, those phenotypic changes are associated with downregulated microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression. To support, overexpression of miR-21 blocks galangin-mediated antisurvival and metastasis effects on CCA cells. Mechanically, galangin increases the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), a direct target of miR-21, resulting in decreased phosphorylation of AKT, a protein kinase which plays a critical role in controlling survival and apoptosis. In contrast, overexpression of miR-21 abrogates galangin-regulated PTEN expression and AKT phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings indicate that galangin inhibits CCA cell proliferation and metastasis and induces cell apoptosis through a miR-21-dependent manner, and galangin may provide a novel potential therapeutic adjuvant to treat CCA.",BioMed research international
5,miR-21 targets 15-PGDH and promotes cholangiocarcinoma growth.,"miRNAs are a group of small, noncoding RNAs that modulate the translation of genes by binding to specific target sites in the target mRNA. This study investigated the biologic function and molecular mechanism of miR-21 in human cholangiocarcinoma. In situ hybridization analysis of human cholangiocarcinoma specimens showed increased miR-21 in cholangiocarcinoma tissue compared with the noncancerous biliary epithelium. Lentiviral transduction of miR-21 enhanced human cholangiocarcinoma cell growth and clonogenic efficiency in vitro, whereas inhibition of miR-21 decreased these parameters. Overexpression of miR-21 also promoted cholangiocarcinoma growth using an in vivo xenograft model system. The NAD(+)-linked 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH/HPGD), a key enzyme that converts the protumorigenic prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to its biologically inactive metabolite, was identified as a direct target of miR-21 in cholangiocarcinoma cells. In parallel, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) overexpression and PGE2 treatment increased miR-21 levels and enhanced miR-21 promoter activity in human cholangiocarcinoma cells. Implications: Cholangiocarcinogenesis and tumor progression are regulated by a novel interplay between COX-2/PGE2 and miR-21 signaling, which converges at 15-PGDH.",Molecular cancer research : MCR
6,"Circulating microRNA-21 as a prognostic, biological marker in cholangiocarcinoma.","Aims: The prognosis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is generally poor because there is a lack of effective diagnostic tools including laboratory assessments and imageological examination. Therefore, a novel biological marker (biomarker) to effectively diagnose cancer is highly desirable in clinical. Previously, serum microRNAs as biomarkers of cancers have been reported. However, it was still unclear about the clinical significance of serum microRNA-21 (miR-21) expression levels for CCA. Materials and methods: The serum samples were separately collected from fifty patients of CCA, 15 patients of hepatolithiasis, and 15 healthy volunteers; quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for measuring miR-21 expression level in serum. The clinicopathological data were recorded before patients discharged. Results: In the CCA serum, the expression level of miR-21 significantly upregulated (P < 0.05). With the tumor, node, and metastasis stage developed (Stage I vs. III and IV, P < 0.05), the serum miR-21 expression level increased, but there was no statistical difference between Stage I patients and hepatolithiasis patients or healthy control (P > 0.05 for both). Furthermore, the miR-21 level was significant difference between pre- and post-operative serum (P < 0.05) for the high miR-21 expression group. The serum miR-21 expression levels were defective in discriminating patients with CCA from healthy control subjects by receiver-operator curve analysis because the area under the curve (AUC) value was 0.871 which was not better than the conventional CCA markers-carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (AUC value = 0.96). However, in serum, high expression level miR-21 was significantly related to clinical stage, invasion depth, lymph vessel infiltration, metastasis status, differentiation status, whether to resection, and poor survival of CCA patients (P < 0.05 for all). Conclusions: This study suggested that serum miR-21 was a promising biomarker for diagnosing the late stage CCA and would have potential to be a useful prognostic biomarker of CCA.",Journal of cancer research and therapeutics
7,Diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNAs in cholangiocarcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background and aim: Several dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA); however, small sample sizes and invariable research designs are limitations, hindering a thorough analysis of miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic tools for CCA. This study aimed to systematically summarize the clinical value of miRNAs in human CCA both for all available miRNAs and single miRNA with multiple researches. Methods: Pooled parameters included the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and hazard ratios (HRs) to separately determine overall diagnostic and prognostic performance. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed only in the event of heterogeneity. Thirty-four studies including 12 diagnostic studies and 22 prognostic studies were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Results: We observed that miR-21, miR-26, miR-483, miR-106a, miR-150, miR-192, and miR-194 were employed for distinguishing patients with CCA from healthy controls. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.86), 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91), respectively. Abnormal expression of miR-21, miR-26a, miR-192, miR-200c, miR-221, miR-29a, miR-191, miR-181c, miR-34a, miR-106a, miR-203, and miR-373 in patients was confirmed to associate with poor survival rate. Pooled HRs and 95% CIs were calculated using STATA, resulting in the pooled HR of 1.47 (95% CI 0.91-2.37) for overall survival (OS), 0.67 (95% CI 0.16-2.81) for disease-free survival (DFS), 2.31 (95% CI 1.59-3.36) for progression-free survival (PFS), and 2.68 (95% CI 0.88-8.15) for relapse-free survival (RFS). Thus, CCA patients with dysregulated miRNA expression were confirmed to have shorter OS, DFS, PFS, and RFS. Data regarding the diagnostic and prognostic roles of miR-21 suggested pooled diagnostic results of miR-21 for sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.91), 0.92 (95% CI 0.81-0.97), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.91-0.95), respectively, suggesting better diagnostic performance of miR-21 compared with other miRNAs. Meanwhile, pooled prognostic result of miR-21 for HR was 1.88 (95% CI 1.41-2.51), indicating miR-21 could more appropriately predict shorter OS in patients with CCA. Conclusion: miRNAs may provide a new approach for clinical application, and miR-21 may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CCA.",Cancer management and research
8,Urinary microRNA-192 and microRNA-21 as potential indicators for liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma risk group.,"Opisthorchis viverrini infection induces chronic inflammation in the bile ducts, leading to periductal fibrosis (PDF), which possibly associates to cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Patients with CCA have a poor prognosis, which is linked to asymptomatic disease and late diagnosis. Hence, detecting early stage CCA is essential. Secretory miRNAs have been promoted as biomarkers for pathological changes associated with parasitic infections, fibrosis and/or cancer. We aimed to determine levels of miR-192 and miR-21 in the urine of O. viverrini infected, periductal fibrosis (PDF) and CCA groups using qRT-PCR. We found that miR-192 was significantly higher in O. viverrini infected, PDF and also CCA groups (p<0.05) than in healthy controls. By utilizing the Receiver Operation Characteristics (ROC) analysis, miR-192 differentiated patients with opisthorchiasis (the area under the curve; AUC=0.766), PDF subjects (AUC=0.781) and CCA patients (AUC=0.682) from healthy controls. MiR-21 was significantly higher in PDF and CCA groups (p<0.05) than in healthy controls. MiR-21 discriminated PDF subjects (AUC=0.735) and CCA patients (AUC=0.682) from healthy controls. Combined levels of these two miRNAs revealed an increased AUC of 0.812 for separating opisthorchiasis, AUC of 0.815 in discriminating PDF subjects, and AUC of 0.849 in differentiating CCA from healthy controls. Odds ratios (OR) indicated high levels of miR-192/miR-21 as risk predictors for opisthorchiasis, PDF and CCA. Levels of these miRNAs declined significantly for patients following praziquantel treatment. In conclusion, urinary miR-192/miR-21 have potential as risk indicators for opisthorchiasis and PDF-associated CCA in the endemic region.",Parasitology international
9,Circulating Plasma Levels of MicroRNA-21 and MicroRNA-221 Are Potential Diagnostic Markers for Primary Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are potential biomarkers in various malignancies. We aim to characterize miRNA expression in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and identify circulating plasma miRNAs with potential diagnostic and prognostic utility. Methods: Using deep-sequencing techniques, miRNA expression between tumor samples and non-neoplastic liver parenchyma were compared. Overexpressed miRNAs were measured in plasma from an independent cohort of patients with cholangiocarcinoma using RT-qPCR and compared with that healthy volunteers. The discriminatory ability of the evaluated plasma miRNAs between patients and controls was evaluated with receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results: Small RNAs from 12 ICC and 11 tumor-free liver samples were evaluated. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering using the miRNA expression data showed clear grouping of ICC vs. non-neoplastic liver parenchyma. We identified 134 down-regulated and 128 upregulated miRNAs. Based on overexpression and high fold-change, miR21, miR200b, miR221, and miR34c were measured in plasma from an independent cohort of patients with ICC (n = 25) and healthy controls (n = 7). Significant overexpression of miR-21 and miR-221 was found in plasma from ICC patients. Furthermore, circulating miR-21 demonstrated a high discriminatory ability between patients with ICC and healthy controls (AUC: 0.94). Conclusion: Among the differentially expressed miRNAs in ICC, miR-21 and miR-221 are overexpressed and detectable in the circulation. Plasma expression levels of these miRNAs, particularly miR-21, accurately differentiates patients with ICC from healthy controls and could potentially serve as adjuncts in diagnosis. Prospective validation and comparison with other hepatobiliary malignancies is required to establish their potential role as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.",PloS one

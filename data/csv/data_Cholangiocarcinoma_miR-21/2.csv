0,"miRNA profiling for diagnosis, prognosis and stratification of cancer treatment in cholangiocarcinoma.","Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a lethal malignancy originating from the biliary tract epithelium. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Even after resection with curative intent, prognosis remains poor. Previous studies have reported the evolving role of miRNAs as novel biomarkers in cancer diagnosis, prognostication and chemotherapy response. Various miRNAs, such as miR-21, miR-26, miR-122 and miR-150, have been identified as possible blood-based biomarkers for noninvasive diagnosis of CCA. Moreover, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)- and angiogenesis-associated miRNAs have been implicated in tumor cell dissemination and are able to determine clinical outcome. In fact, miRNAs involved in cell survival might even determine chemotherapy response. This review provides an overview of known miRNAs as CCA-specific biomarkers.",Pharmacogenomics
1,MicroRNA-21 regulates biological behavior by inducing EMT in human cholangiocarcinoma.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been demonstrated to play a crucial role in malignant progression including differentiation, proliferation, metastasis and invasion, MicroRNA-21 (mir-21) also has been reported to have association with tumor invasion and metastasis in some tumors including cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In this study, we further investigated the association of mir-21 with CCA biological behavior by transfecting miR-21 mimics or mir-21 inhibitor into QBC939 and RBE cells accompanied with the tumor xenografts experiment. Results indicated that over-expression of miR-21 significantly promoted cell migration, invasion and xenografts growth, whereas contrary phenomenon was observed in mir-21 inhibitor group. Furthermore, we explored the expression of EMT related proteins in CCA cells and tumor xenografts. Results showed that E-cadherin was decreased and N-cadherin, Vimentin were up-regulated significantly when miR-21 was over-expressed. In conclusion, microRNA-21 is crucial for CCA carcinogenesis and metastasis, which could induce EMT process, thereby promote the invasion and migration of CCA cells. These findings may provide new strategy for prevention and treatment of CCA in the future.",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology
2,Expression profiles of oncomir miR-21 and tumor suppressor let-7a in the progression of opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma.,"Altered miRNA expression could be a determinant of cancer development and/or progression. We aimed to study the role of oncomir miR-21 and tumor suppressor let-7a in the genesis of Opisthorchiasis-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The results showed that miR-21 was up-regulated while let-7a was down-regulated during cholangiocarcinogenesis in the hamster model and also in human CCA samples. The expression level of miR-21 had an inverse correlation with the mRNA level of its target RECK, a metastasis suppressor, in human CCA. Knockdown of miR-21 of KKU100 CCA cells significantly increased the mRNA level of RECK and suppressed the wound-induced migration of CCA cells. Our data suggest that miR-21 is one key molecule playing crucial roles in the CCA growth and metastasis. Manipulation of miRNA expression offers a potential avenue of CCA therapy.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
3,MicroRNA-21 is overexpressed in human cholangiocarcinoma and regulates programmed cell death 4 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3.,"Cholangiocarcinomas (CCAs) are aggressive cancers, with high mortality and poor survival rates. Only radical surgery offers patients some hope of cure; however, most patients are not surgical candidates because of late diagnosis secondary to relatively poor accuracy of diagnostic means. MicroRNAs (miRs) are involved in every cancer examined, but they have not been evaluated in primary CCA. In this study, miR arrays were performed on five primary CCAs and five normal bile duct specimens (NBDs). Several miRs were dysregulated and miR-21 was overexpressed in CCAs. miR-21 differential expression in these 10 specimens was verified by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). To validate these findings, qRT-PCR for miR-21 was then performed on 18 additional primary CCAs and 12 normal liver specimens. MiR-21 was 95% sensitive and 100% specific in distinguishing between CCA and normal tissues, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.995. Inhibitors of miR-21 increased protein levels of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3). Notably, messenger RNA levels of TIMP3 were significantly lower in CCAs than in normals. Conclusions: MiR-21 is overexpressed in human CCAs. Furthermore, miR-21 may be oncogenic, at least in part, by inhibiting PDCD4 and TIMP3. Finally, these data suggest that TIMP3 is a candidate tumor suppressor gene in the biliary tree.","Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)"
4,"Expression of microRNAs, miR-21, miR-31, miR-122, miR-145, miR-146a, miR-200c, miR-221, miR-222, and miR-223 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma or intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and its prognostic significance.","MicroRNAs are a class of non-coding molecules found to regulate a variety of cellular functions in health and disease. Dysregulation of microRNAs is involved in liver disease, especially hepatocarcinogenesis. Since primary hepatic malignancies are typically characterized by late diagnosis, frequent recurrence, and poor response to adjuvant therapy, there is a need for the discovery of novel biomarkers in order to achieve earlier diagnosis, predict tumor aggressiveness and response to adjuvant therapy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the expression of certain microRNAs (miR-21, -31, -122, -145, -146a, - 200c, -221, -222 and -223) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), as well as to assess their prognostic significance. Micro-RNA expression was assessed by reverse transcription and real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Clinicopathological data and survival rates were retrieved and analyzed. According to our results, miR-21, miR-31, miR-122, miR-221, miR-222 were significantly up-regulated in HCC tissues, whereas miR-145, miR-146a, miR-200c, and miR-223 were found to be down-regulated. Concerning ICC samples, miR-21, miR-31, and miR-223 were found to be over-expressed, whereas miR-122, miR-145, miR-200c, miR-221, and miR-222 were down-regulated. Additionally, expression of miR-21, miR-31, miR-122, and miR-221 in HCC correlated with cirrhosis, while miR-21 and miR-221 associated with tumor stage and poor prognosis. In ICC tissues, miR-21, miR-31, and miR-223 were found to be over-expressed, but no correlation with clinicopathological features was found.",Molecular carcinogenesis
5,Overexpression of microRNA-21 regulating PDCD4 during tumorigenesis of liver fluke-associated cholangiocarcinoma contributes to tumor growth and metastasis.,"MicroRNA, an endogenous noncoding RNA modulating gene expression, is a key molecule that by its dysregulation plays roles in inflammatory-driven carcinogenesis. This study aimed to investigate the role of oncomiR miR-21 and its target, the programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4) in tumor growth and metastasis of the liver fluke Opisthorchis viverrini-associated cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). The expression levels of miR-21 and PDCD4 were analyzed using the TaqMan miRNA expression assay and immunohistochemistry in liver tissues of both O. viverrini plus N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA)-treated hamsters and human CCA samples (n=23 cases). The functional assay for miR-21 was performed in CCA cell lines by the anti-miR-21 and pre-miR-21 transfection procedures. The peak of miR-21 levels were reached at 2 (hyperplastic lesions) and 6 (CCA) months of the O. viverrini plus NDMA-induced group and had a reverse response with its target PDCD4 proteins. In human CCA, miR-21 was overexpressed in tumor tissues when compared with nontumor tissues (P=0.0034) and had a negative correlation with PDCD4 protein (P=0.026). It was also found that high expression of miR-21 was significantly correlated with shorter survival (P<0.05) and lymph node metastasis (P=0.037) of CCA patients. Transient transfection of pre-miR-21 reduced the PDCD4 level and resulted in an increase of M213 CCA cell growth and wound-induced migration ability. These results indicated that miR-21 plays a role in the carcinogenesis and metastasis of O. viverrini-associated CCA by suppressing the function of PDCD4. Modulation of aberrantly expressed miR-21 may be a useful strategy to inhibit tumor cell phenotypes or improve response to chemotherapy.",Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine
6,miR-21 Inhibition Reduces Liver Fibrosis and Prevents Tumor Development by Inducing Apoptosis of CD24+ Progenitor Cells.,"miR-21 is upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, where it is associated with poor prognosis. Here, we offer preclinical evidence that miR-21 offers a therapeutic and chemopreventive target in these liver cancers. In mice with hepatic deletion of Pten, anti-miR-21 treatment reduced liver tumor growth and prevented tumor development. These effects were accompanied with a decrease in liver fibrosis and a concomitant reduction of CD24(+) liver progenitor cells and S100A4(+) cancer-associated stromal cells. Notch2 inhibition also occurred in tumors following anti-miR-21 treatment. We further showed that miR-21 is necessary for the survival of CD24(+) progenitor cells, a cellular phenotype mediated by Notch2, osteopontin, and integrin Î±v. Our results identify miR-21 as a key regulator of tumor-initiating cell survival, malignant development, and growth in liver cancer, highlighting the role of CD24(+) cells in the expansion of S100A4(+) cancer-associated stromal cells and associated liver fibrosis.",Cancer research
7,Ars2 is overexpressed in human cholangiocarcinomas and its depletion increases PTEN and PDCD4 by decreasing microRNA-21.,"Due to the lack of effective diagnostic tools, most patients with cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) have no chance of surgical resection. Ars2 is a protein that was reported to be important for microRNA (miR) biogenesis, and its depletion can reduce the levels of several miRs, including miR-21, which is overexpressed in CCAs. We hypothesized that Ars2 was also present in CCAs and could be an early diagnostic marker. In our experiments, Ars2, PTEN, PDCD4, and miR-21 were evaluated in 18 CCAs and paired normal tissues. ShArs2, miR-21 mimics, and Ars2 were transfected into CCA and bile duct epithelial cells either alone or together. Cell proliferation, tumorigenicity analysis and expression changes of Ars2, PTEN, PDCD4, and miR-21 were evaluated. We found that both Ars2 and miR-21 were overexpressed, with 95% sensitivity and 100% specificity, and an ROC of 0.995 in distinguishing between CCAs and paired normal tissues by qRT-PCR. PTEN and PDCD4 were reversed in immunohistochemistry, but no difference was observed using qRT-PCR. The knockdown of Ars2 in CCA cells decreased the level of miR-21, inhibited cell proliferation and prevented tumor formation in nude mice. Ars2 knockdown also led to an increase in both PTEN and PDCD4 protein levels. Both proteins decreased when the miR-21 mimic was con-transfected. However, the overexpression of Ars2 alone could not get the opposite results. Based on our data, we conclude that Ars2 is overexpressed in human CCA and may be a diagnostic marker. Ars2 depletion increases PTEN and PDCD4 protein levels via the reduction of miR-21.",Molecular carcinogenesis
8,Genetic and epigenetic alterations are involved in the regulation of TPM1 in cholangiocarcinoma.,"Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor originating from biliary epithelial cells. The tumor suppressor gene tropomyosin 1 (TPM1) is downregulated in several human cancer types; however, its expression status in cholangiocarcinoma is still unknown. We elucidated TPM1 expression and its regulation mechanism in cholangiocarcinoma. Real-time (RT)-PCR, western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine TPM1 expression levels in cholangiocarcinoma cell lines and tumor tissues. Cell lines were treated with lentiviral vector containing the miR-21 knockdown and inhibitors of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms (manumycin A, LY294002, U0126, DAC and TSA), and the TPM1 expression change was observed by RT-PCR and western blot analyses. Cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration were evaluated by water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay, flow cytometry and wound healing experiments, respectively. TPM1 was downregulated in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells (HuCCT1) and upregulated in the extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cells (QBC939) compared with normal intrahepatic biliary epithelial cells (HIBEC). TPM1 stained negative in the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues, as revealed by immunohistochemistry, although there was no significant difference in staining of the intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma tissues and adjacent non-cancer tissues. RAS and two important downstream signaling pathways (RAS/PI3K/AKT and RAS/MEK/ERK) were involved in TPM1 regulation and inhibition of the epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation, histone deacetylation and miR-21 upregulation upregulated TPM1 expression. Inhibitors of genetic and epigenetic mechanisms (manumycin A, LY294002, U0126, DAC and TSA) inhibited cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis. These data indicated that TPM1 is downregulated in HuCCT1 cells and that the Ras signaling pathway as well as DNA methylation, histone deacetylation and miR-21 upregulation play important roles in the suppression of TPM1 expression in HuCCT1 cells. Thus, compounds that inhibit genetic and epigenetic mechanisms may be promising agents in treating cholangiocarcinoma.",International journal of oncology
9,Involvement of human micro-RNA in growth and response to chemotherapy in human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines.,"Background & aims: Micro-RNA (miRNA) are endogenous regulatory RNA molecules that modulate gene expression. Alterations in miRNA expression can contribute to tumor growth by modulating the functional expression of critical genes involved in tumor cell proliferation or survival. Our aims were to identify specific miRNA involved in the regulation of cholangiocarcinoma growth and response to chemotherapy. Methods: miRNA expression in malignant and nonmalignant human cholangiocytes was assessed using a microarray. Expression of selected miRNA and their precursors was evaluated by Northern blots and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The effect of selected miRNA on cell growth and response to chemotherapy was assessed using miRNA-specific antisense oligonucleotides to decrease miRNA expression or with precursor miRNA to increase cellular expression. Results: miRNA expression was markedly different in malignant cholangiocytes, with decreased expression of many miRNA compared with nonmalignant cells. A cluster of miRNA, including miR-320, miR-200b, miR-21, miR-23a, miR-141, miR-27a, and miR-34a, were expressed in all cell lines. MiR-21, miR-141, and miR-200b were highly over-expressed in malignant cholangiocytes. Inhibition of miR-21 and miR-200b increased sensitivity to gemcitabine, whereas inhibition of miR-141 decreased cell growth. Treatment of tumor cell xenografts with systemic gemcitabine altered the expression of a significant number of miRNA. miR-21 modulates gemcitabine-induced apoptosis by phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN)-dependent activation of PI 3-kinase signaling. Potential target genes that were modulated by selected miRNA were identified. Conclusions: Alterations in miRNA expression contribute to tumor growth and response to chemotherapy. Aberrantly expressed miRNA or their targets will provide mechanistic insight and therapeutic targets for cholangiocarcinoma.",Gastroenterology

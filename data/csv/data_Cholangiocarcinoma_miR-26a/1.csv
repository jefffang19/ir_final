0,Serum miR-26a as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in cholangiocarcinoma.,"In order to determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of miR-26a in Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), we compared miR-26a levels in serum from 66 CCA patients and 66 healthy controls, which was followed by serum analysis between the pre-operative serum and post-operative serum of these CCA patients. We found the concentration levels of miR-26a in serum of CCA patients were significantly higher than that from healthy controls (P < 0.01). Furthermore, the concentration levels of miR-26a in the post-operative serum were significantly reduced when compared to the pre-operative serum (P < 0.001). High miR-26a in serum was correlated significantly with clinical stage, distant metastasis, differentiation status, and poor survival of CCA patients. More importantly, serum miR-26a was an independent prognostic marker for CCA. In conclusion, our results suggested that miR-26a in serum might be a potential and useful noninvasive biomarker for the early detection of CCA.",Oncotarget
1,Bioinformatics Analysis Identifies the Estrogen Receptor 1 (ESR1) Gene and hsa-miR-26a-5p as Potential Prognostic Biomarkers in Patients with Intrahepatic Cholangiocarcinoma.,"BACKGROUND Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma arises from the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and is associated with poor prognosis. This study aimed to use bioinformatics analysis to identify molecular biomarkers of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and their potential mechanisms. MATERIAL AND METHODS MicroRNA (miRNA) and mRNA microarrays from GSE53870 and GSE32879 were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) associated with prognosis were identified using limma software and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Predictive target genes of the DEMs were identified using miRWalk, miRTarBase, miRDB, and TargetScan databases of miRNA-binding sites and targets. Target genes underwent Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. Hub genes were analyzed by constructing the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network using Cytoscape. DEMs validated the hub genes, followed by construction of the miRNA-gene regulatory network. RESULTS Twenty-five DEMs were identified. Fifteen DEMs were upregulated, and ten were down-regulated. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis identified seven upregulated DEMs and nine down-regulated DEMs that were associated with the overall survival (OS), and 130 target genes were selected. GO analysis showed that target genes were mainly enriched for metabolism and development processes. KEGG analysis showed that target genes were mainly enriched for cancer processes and some signaling pathways. Fourteen hub genes identified from the PPI network were associated with the regulation of cell proliferation. The overlap between hub genes and DEMs identified the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene and hsa-miR-26a-5p. CONCLUSIONS Bioinformatics analysis identified ESR1 and hsa-miR-26a-5p as potential prognostic biomarkers for intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research
2,miR-26a induced the suppression of tumor growth of cholangiocarcinoma via KRT19 approach.,"Background and aims: KRT19 was identified as one of the key biomarkers for distinguishing cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and hepatocellular carcinoma. The detailed role of miRNAs involved in the oncogenic incident of KRT19 was poor investigated. Results: Based on prediction and validation, miR-26a was inversely correlated with KRT19 in patients' tissues samples and biopsies. Ectopic expression of miR-26a dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and tumor growth in vitro and in vivo. Knock-down miR-26a could induce an increasing population of SP cells by promoting KRT19 expression. The KRT19 was also suppressed via directly binding at 3'UTR region by miR-26a. Materials and methods: Bioinformatics prediction was first applied to screening the potential miRNA involved. RT-PCR, Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were used to examine the expression of miRNAs and candidate genes in 65 pairs of cholangiocarcinoma. The loss-and gain-function assay was employed to detect the role of certain miRNA in vitro and vivo. Side-population (SP) cells were detected and sorted by flow cytometry. Conclusions: Aberrant decreased miR-26a could promote cell proliferation by regulating KRT19 which play important roles in the pathogenesis of CCA.",Oncotarget
3,Diagnostic and prognostic value of microRNAs in cholangiocarcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background and aim: Several dysregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of cholangiocarcinoma (CCA); however, small sample sizes and invariable research designs are limitations, hindering a thorough analysis of miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic tools for CCA. This study aimed to systematically summarize the clinical value of miRNAs in human CCA both for all available miRNAs and single miRNA with multiple researches. Methods: Pooled parameters included the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and hazard ratios (HRs) to separately determine overall diagnostic and prognostic performance. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were performed only in the event of heterogeneity. Thirty-four studies including 12 diagnostic studies and 22 prognostic studies were eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis. Results: We observed that miR-21, miR-26, miR-483, miR-106a, miR-150, miR-192, and miR-194 were employed for distinguishing patients with CCA from healthy controls. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 0.82 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.77-0.86), 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), and 0.88 (95% CI 0.85-0.91), respectively. Abnormal expression of miR-21, miR-26a, miR-192, miR-200c, miR-221, miR-29a, miR-191, miR-181c, miR-34a, miR-106a, miR-203, and miR-373 in patients was confirmed to associate with poor survival rate. Pooled HRs and 95% CIs were calculated using STATA, resulting in the pooled HR of 1.47 (95% CI 0.91-2.37) for overall survival (OS), 0.67 (95% CI 0.16-2.81) for disease-free survival (DFS), 2.31 (95% CI 1.59-3.36) for progression-free survival (PFS), and 2.68 (95% CI 0.88-8.15) for relapse-free survival (RFS). Thus, CCA patients with dysregulated miRNA expression were confirmed to have shorter OS, DFS, PFS, and RFS. Data regarding the diagnostic and prognostic roles of miR-21 suggested pooled diagnostic results of miR-21 for sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.91), 0.92 (95% CI 0.81-0.97), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.91-0.95), respectively, suggesting better diagnostic performance of miR-21 compared with other miRNAs. Meanwhile, pooled prognostic result of miR-21 for HR was 1.88 (95% CI 1.41-2.51), indicating miR-21 could more appropriately predict shorter OS in patients with CCA. Conclusion: miRNAs may provide a new approach for clinical application, and miR-21 may be a promising biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of CCA.",Cancer management and research
4,Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Upregulate 15-PGDH Expression in Cholangiocarcinoma Cells by Inhibiting miR-26a/b Expression.,"Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is a proinflammatory lipid mediator that promotes cancer growth. The 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes oxidation of the 15(S)-hydroxyl group of PGE2, leading to its inactivation. Therefore, 15-PGDH induction may offer a strategy to treat cancers that are driven by PGE2, such as human cholangiocarcinoma. Here, we report that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (ω-3 PUFA) upregulate 15-PGDH expression by inhibiting miR-26a and miR-26b, thereby contributing to ω-3 PUFA-induced inhibition of human cholangiocarcinoma cell growth. Treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma cells (CCLP1 and TFK-1) with ω-3 PUFA (DHA) or transfection of these cells with the Fat-1 gene (encoding Caenorhabditis elegans desaturase, which converts ω-6 PUFA to ω-3 PUFA) significantly increased 15-PGDH enzymes levels, but with little effect on the activity of the 15-PGDH gene promoter. Mechanistic investigations revealed that this increase in 15-PGDH levels in cells was mediated by a reduction in the expression of miR-26a and miR-26b, which target 15-PGDH mRNA and inhibit 15-PGDH translation. These findings were extended by the demonstration that overexpressing miR-26a or miR-26b decreased 15-PGDH protein levels, reversed ω-3 PUFA-induced accumulation of 15-PGDH protein, and prevented ω-3 PUFA-induced inhibition of cholangiocarcinoma cell growth. We further observed that ω-3 PUFA suppressed miR-26a and miR-26b by inhibiting c-myc, a transcription factor that regulates miR-26a/b. Accordingly, c-myc overexpression enhanced expression of miR-26a/b and ablated the ability of ω-3 PUFA to inhibit cell growth. Taken together, our results reveal a novel mechanism for ω-3 PUFA-induced expression of 15-PGDH in human cholangiocarcinoma and provide a preclinical rationale for the evaluation of ω-3 PUFA in treatment of this malignancy.",Cancer research
5,MicroRNAs in Serum and Bile of Patients with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and/or Cholangiocarcinoma.,"Background and aim: Patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) are at high risk for the development of cholangiocarcinoma (CC). Analysis of micro ribonucleic acid (MiRNA) patterns is an evolving research field in biliary pathophysiology with potential value in diagnosis and therapy. Our aim was to evaluate miRNA patterns in serum and bile of patients with PSC and/or CC. Methods: Serum and bile from consecutive patients with PSC (n = 40 (serum), n = 52 (bile)), CC (n = 31 (serum), n = 19 (bile)) and patients with CC complicating PSC (PSC/CC) (n = 12 (bile)) were analyzed in a cross-sectional study between 2009 and 2012. As additional control serum samples from healthy individuals were analyzed (n = 12). The miRNA levels in serum and bile were determined with global miRNA profiling and subsequent miRNA-specific polymerase chain reaction-mediated validation. Results: Serum analysis revealed significant differences for miR-1281 (p = 0.001), miR-126 (p = 0.001), miR-26a (p = 0.001), miR-30b (p = 0.001) and miR-122 (p = 0.034) between patients with PSC and patients with CC. All validated miRNAs were significantly lower in healthy individuals. MiR-412 (p = 0.001), miR-640 (p = 0.001), miR-1537 (p = 0.003) and miR-3189 (p = 0.001) were significantly different between patients with PSC and PSC/CC in bile. Conclusions: Patients with PSC and/or CC have distinct miRNA profiles in serum and bile. Furthermore, miRNA concentrations are different in bile of patients with CC on top of PSC indicating the potential diagnostic value of these miRNAs.",PloS one
6,MicroRNA-26a promotes cholangiocarcinoma growth by activating beta-catenin.,"Background & aims: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the development and progression of human cancers. We investigated the roles and mechanisms of miR-26a in human cholangiocarcinoma. Methods: We used in situ hybridization and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to measure expression of miR-26a in human cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cell lines (eg, CCLP1, SG231, HuCCT1, TFK1). Human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines were transduced with lentiviruses that expressed miR-26a1 or a scrambled sequence (control); proliferation and colony formation were analyzed. We analyzed growth of human cholangiocarcinoma cells that overexpress miR-26a or its inhibitor in severe combined immune-deficient mice. Immunoblot, immunoprecipitation, DNA pull-down, immunofluorescence, and luciferase reporter assays were used to measure expression and activity of glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3β, β-catenin, and related signaling molecules. Results: Human cholangiocarcinoma tissues and cell lines had increased levels of miR-26a compared with the noncancerous biliary epithelial cells. Overexpression of miR-26a increased proliferation of cholangiocarcinoma cells and colony formation in vitro, whereas miR-26 depletion reduced these parameters. In severe combined immune-deficient mice, overexpression of miR-26a by cholangiocarcinoma cells increased tumor growth and overexpression of the miR-26a inhibitor reduced it. GSK-3β messenger RNA was identified as a direct target of miR-26a by computational analysis and experimental assays. miR-26a-mediated reduction of GSK-3β resulted in activation of β-catenin and induction of several downstream genes including c-Myc, cyclinD1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor δ. Depletion of β-catenin partially prevented miR-26a-induced tumor cell proliferation and colony formation. Conclusions: miR-26a promotes cholangiocarcinoma growth by inhibition of GSK-3β and subsequent activation of β-catenin. These signaling molecules might be targets for prevention or treatment of cholangiocarcinoma.",Gastroenterology
7,MicroRNA-26a inhibits osteosarcoma cell proliferation by targeting IGF-1.,"There are still controversies about the roles of microRNA-26a (miR-26a) in human malignancies, as it is a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, gastric cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, but is an oncogene in glioma and cholangiocarcinoma. Until now, the function of miR-26a in osteosarcoma remains largely elusive. Here, we found that miR-26a was downregualted in osteosarcoma tissues. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we confirmed that miR-26a could inhibit the abilities of in vitro proliferation and suppress in vivo tumor growth in mouse model. Furthermore, we identified insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) as a novel and direct target of miR-26a and revealed that miR-26a exerted its tumor-suppressor function, at least in part, by inhibiting IGF-1 expression. These findings contribute to our understanding of the functions of miR-26a in osteosarcoma.",Bone research

0,The expression of miR-181a-5p and miR-371b-5p in chondrosarcoma.,"Objective: Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumors of chondrocytes that affect bones and joints, and it represents the third most common type of primary bone tumors. Chondrosarcoma is difficult to treat because it is relatively resistant to both chemotherapy and radiation. Thus, surgery remains the best available treatment. It is important to find new diagnostic markers and improve treatment options. Background: miRNAs are small non-coding transcripts (19-25 nucleotides) that regulate gene expression via targeting complementary sequences within messenger RNAs (mRNAs). miRNAs have been shown to be involved in regulation of many biochemical pathways. Dysregulated expression of many miRNAs has also been associated with multiple human diseases, such as cancer. Patients and methods: 18 surgical chondrosarcoma specimens were obtained from patients. RNA extractions were performed from decalcified paraffin embedded tissues. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression levels of miR-181a and miR-371b in patients with chondrosarcoma by using RT-PCR and to evaluate the relationship between these miRNAs and chondrosarcoma. Results: miR-181a was found to be upregulated in chondrosarcoma specimens whereas no significant alteration was found for miR-371b expression. Conclusions: It has been proposed that miRNA expression studies might be used as diagnostic, prognostic marker in cancer. miRNA expression data produced in our study may contribute future chondrosarcoma diagnosis and therapy.",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences
1,"miR-181a Targets RGS16 to Promote Chondrosarcoma Growth, Angiogenesis, and Metastasis.","Chondrosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in adults, has no effective systemic treatment, and patients with this disease have poor survival. Altered expression of microRNA (miR) is involved in tumorigenesis; however, its role in chondrosarcoma is undetermined. miR-181a is overexpressed in high-grade chondrosarcoma, is upregulated by hypoxia, and increases VEGF expression. Here, the purpose was to determine the mechanism of miR-181a regulation of VEGF, determine whether miR-181a overexpression promotes tumor progression, and to evaluate an antagomir-based approach for chondrosarcoma treatment. Therapeutic inhibition of miR-181a decreased expression of VEGF and MMP1 in vitro, and angiogenesis, MMP1 activity, tumor growth, and lung metastasis, all by more than 50%, in a xenograft mouse model. A target of miR-181a is a regulator of G-protein signaling 16 (RGS16), a negative regulator of CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) signaling. CXCR4 signaling is increased in chondrosarcoma, its expression is also increased by hypoxia, and is associated with angiogenesis and metastasis; however, receptor blockade is only partially effective. RGS16 expression is restored after miR-181a inhibition and partially accounts for the antiangiogenic and antimetastatic effects of miR-181a inhibition. These data establish miR-181a as an oncomiR that promotes chondrosarcoma progression through a new mechanism involving enhancement of CXCR4 signaling by inhibition of RGS16. Implications: Targeting miR-181a can inhibit tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis, thus suggesting the possibility of antagomir-based therapy in chondrosarcoma.",Molecular cancer research : MCR
2,Anti-miRNA Oligonucleotide Therapy for Chondrosarcoma.,"Chondrosarcoma is a highly aggressive primary malignant bone tumor mostly occurring in adults. There are no effective systemic treatments, and patients with this disease have poor survival. miR-181a is an oncomiR that is overexpressed in high-grade chondrosarcoma and promotes tumor progression. Regulator of G-protein signaling 16 (RGS16) is a target of miR-181a. Inhibition of RGS16 expression by miR-181a enhances CXC chemokine receptor 4 signaling, which in turn increases MMP1 and VEGF expression, angiogenesis, and metastasis. Here, we report the results of systemic treatment with anti-miRNA oligonucleotides (AMO) directed against miR-181a utilizing a nanopiece delivery platform (NPs). NPs were combined with a molecular beacon or anti-miR-181a oligonucleotides and are shown to transfect chondrosarcoma cells in vitro and in vivo Intratumoral injection and systemic delivery had similar effects on miR-181a expression in nude mice bearing chondrosarcoma xenografts. Systemic delivery of NPs carrying anti-miR-181a also restored RGS16 expression, decreased expression of VEGF and MMP1, MMP activity, and tumor volume by 32% at day 38, and prolonged survival from 23% to 45%. In conclusion, these data support that systemic delivery of AMO shows promise for chondrosarcoma treatment.",Molecular cancer therapeutics
3,Use of MicroRNA biomarkers to distinguish enchondroma from low-grade chondrosarcoma.,"Establishing a definitive diagnosis between benign enchondroma versus low-grade chondrosarcoma presents a potential challenge to both clinicians and pathologists. microRNAs (small non-coding RNAs) have proven to be effective biomarkers for the identification of tumors and tumor progression. We present analysis, both array and quantitative PCR, that shows consistently and substantially increased expression of two microRNAs, miRs-181a and -138, in low-grade chondrosarcomas compared with enchondromas. The data suggest these microRNAs would provide an analytical distinction between the chondrosarcoma and benign neoplasms that can be performed in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens. Together with recent publications, these data indicate that miRs-181a and -138 also play a role in tumor development and homeostasis and may provide new targets for the development of much needed therapeutic intervention.",Connective tissue research
4,Analysis of microRNAs expressions in chondrosarcoma.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs capable of inhibiting gene expression post-transcriptionally and expression profiling can provide therapeutic targets and tools for cancer diagnosis. Chondrosarcoma is a mesenchymal tumor with unknown cause and differentiation status. Here, we profiled miRNA expression of chondrosarcoma, namely clinical samples from human conventional chondrosarcoma tissue, established chondrosarcoma cell lines, and primary non-tumorous adult articular chondrocytes, by miRNA array and quantitative real-time PCR. A wide variety of miRNAs were differently downregulated in chondrosarcoma compared to non-tumorous articular chondrocytes; 27 miRNAs: miR-10b, 23b, 24-1*, 27b, 100, 134, 136, 136*, 138, 181d, 186, 193b, 221*, 222, 335, 337-5p, 376a, 376a*, 376b, 376c, 377, 454, 495, 497, 505, 574-3p, and 660, were significantly downregulated in chondrosarcoma and only 2: miR-96 and 183, were upregulated. We further validated the expression levels of miRNAs by quantitative real-time PCR for miR-181a, let-7a, 100, 222, 136, 376a, and 335 in extended number of chondrosarcoma clinical samples. Among them, all except miR-181a were found to be significantly downregulated in chondrosarcoma derived samples. The findings provide potential diagnostic value and new molecular understanding of chondrosarcoma.",Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society
5,MicroRNA regulates vascular endothelial growth factor expression in chondrosarcoma cells.,"Background: Systemic treatments to prevent or treat chondrosarcoma metastasis are lacking and targeted therapy has yet to be developed. Hypoxia develops in tumors as they grow and hypoxia-related alterations in gene expression underlie some of the traits of cancer. One critical trait is the ability to induce sustained angiogenesis, which is usually related to expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). A potential hypoxia-related mechanism resulting in altered gene expression involves microRNA. Little is known about microRNA expression in chondrosarcoma and its potential role in regulation of VEGF expression. Questions/purposes: Our purposes were (1) to determine if there is hypoxia-regulated microRNA overexpressed in chondrosarcoma; (2) if that contributes to increased VEGF expression; and (3) can VEGF expression be inhibited with a specific antagomir? Methods: MicroRNA expression was analyzed in two primary human chondrosarcomas and articular cartilage using array analysis and a cutoff of a fourfold difference in expression between tumor and normal tissue. The effects of hypoxia and hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) transfection and silencing with siRNA on expression of candidate microRNAs were analyzed in chondrosarcoma cell line JJ. VEGF expression was measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after specific microRNA transfection and knockdown. Results: miR-181a was identified by array analysis and confirmed with quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, which showed that miR-181a was overexpressed in both human chondrosarcomas (33- and 55-fold) and the JJ cell line (sixfold) compared with cartilage and chondrocytes, respectively. In vitro, hypoxia and HIF-1α transfection each further increased miR-181a expression twofold in JJ cells. miR-181a transfection of JJ cells doubled expression of VEGF mRNA and increased secreted VEGF protein by 46% in normoxia, an effect that could be either direct or indirect. Similar enhancement of VEGF expression by miR-181a was found during hypoxia. Transfection with the antagomir anti-miR-181a decreased VEGF protein by 27% in normoxia and 23% in hypoxia. Conclusions: miR-181a is a hypoxia-regulated microRNA that is overexpressed in chondrosarcoma and enhances VEGF expression, an effect that could be inhibited by anti-miR-181a. Clinical relevance: Systemic treatment options for chondrosarcoma are limited. Antiangiogenic strategies could potentially be effective in limiting tumor progression. One method of inhibiting VEGF expression and associated angiogenesis could be an antagomir-based therapy targeted at miR-181a or other oncogenic microRNAs, although methods of systemic delivery are still under development. The effectiveness of antagomirs also needs to be compared with other antiangiogenic modalities in preclinical models.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research

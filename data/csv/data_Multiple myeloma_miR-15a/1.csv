0,The Role and Function of microRNA in the Pathogenesis of Multiple Myeloma.,"Recently, attention has been drawn to the role of non-coding regions of the genome in cancer pathogenesis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs with 19-25 bases of length that control gene expression by destroying messenger RNA or inhibiting its translation. In multiple myeloma (MM), the expression of several miRNAs, such as miR-15a and miR-16, is markedly decreased and their target genes upregulated, suggesting their role as tumor-suppressing miRNAs. In contrast, miRNAs such as miR-21 and miR-221 are highly expressed and function as oncogenes (oncomiRs). In addition, several miRNAs, such as those belonging to the miR-34 family, are transcriptional targets of p53 and mediate its tumor-suppressive functions. Many miRNAs are associated with drug resistance, and the modulation of their expression or activity might be explored to reverse it. Moreover, miRNA expression patterns in either MM cells or serum exosomes have been shown to be good prognostic markers. miRNA regulation mechanisms have not been fully elucidated. Many miRNAs are epigenetically controlled by DNA methylation and histone modification, and others regulate the expression of epigenetic modifiers, indicating that miRNA and other epigenetic effectors are part of a network. In this review, we outlined the roles of miRNAs in MM and their potential to predict MM prognosis and develop novel therapies.",Cancers
1,Polycomb-like Protein 3 Induces Proliferation and Drug Resistance in Multiple Myeloma and Is Regulated by miRNA-15a.,"Multiple myeloma remains incurable due to the persistence of a minor population of multiple myeloma cells that exhibit drug resistance, which leads to relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. Elucidating the mechanism underlying drug resistance and developing an effective treatment are critical for clinical management of multiple myeloma. Here we showed that promoting expression of the gene for polycomb-like protein 3 (PHF19) induced multiple myeloma cell growth and multidrug resistance in vitro and in vivo. PHF19 was overexpressed in high-risk and drug-resistant primary cells from patients. High levels of PHF19 were correlated with inferior survival of patients with multiple myeloma, in the Total Therapy 2 cohort and in the Intergroup Francophone du Myeloma (IFM) cohort. Enhancing PHF19 expression levels increased Bcl-xL, Mcl-1, and HIF-1a expression in multiple myeloma cells. PHF19 also bound directly with EZH2 and promoted the phosphorylation of EZH2 through PDK1/AKT signaling. miR-15a is a small noncoding RNA that targeted the 3'UTR of PHF19. We found that downregulation of miR-15a led to high levels of PHF19 in multiple myeloma cells. These findings revealed that PHF19 served a crucial role in multiple myeloma proliferation and drug resistance and suggested that the miR-15a/PHF19/EZH2 pathway made a pivotal contribution to multiple myeloma pathogenesis, offering a promising approach to multiple myeloma treatment. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings identify that PHF19 mediates EZH2 phosphorylation as a mechanism of myeloma cell drug resistance, providing a rationale to explore therapeutic potential of targeting PHF19 in relapsed or refractory patients with multiple myeloma.",Molecular cancer research : MCR
2,Therapeutic effects of oligo-single-stranded DNA mimicking of hsa-miR-15a-5p on multiple myeloma.,"Despite the fact that a few novel agents improve the outcome of patients, MM remains incurable. Hence, developing a novel treatment strategy may prove to be promising for the clinical management of MM. Noncoding small RNAs, a cluster of RNAs that do not encode functional proteins, have been underlined that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of MM. Our previous study indicated that miR-15a acted as a tumor suppressor, which inhibited the cell proliferation and promoted the apoptosis of MM cells. The level of miR-15a was downregulated in MM cells and correlated with inferior outcome of MM patients. In the present study, we first developed an oligo-single-stranded DNA mimicking the sequence of hsa-miR-15a-5p (OMM-15a) and modified with locked nucleic acid (LNA-15a) to evaluate its anti-MM effects. Our results indicated that the LNA-15a presented an exciting anti-MM effect that showed notable cell growth suppression and apoptosis promotion in MM and other cancer cell lines through downregulating the expression level of target genes BCL-2, VEGF-A, and PHF19. Moreover, LNA-15a treatment significantly improved the anti-MM activity of bortezomib with the synergism effect in OCI-My5 MM cells. In our in vivo study, LNA-15a treatment significantly suppressed the tumor growth, and prolonged the survival of mice compared with the control group. However, our results indicated that the native form of oligo-single-stranded DNA mimic of hsa-miR-15a-5p (OMM-15a) without any modification had no effective inhibition on cell growth, even after increasing the dosage of OMM-15a in the treatment. Altogether, our finding provides the preclinical rationale to support the oligo-single-stranded DNA mimic of hsa-miR-15a with LNA modification, which is a promising tool for the therapy of both MM and other tumors with miR-15a downregulation.",Cancer gene therapy
3,"MiR-15a/16 regulates the growth of myeloma cells, angiogenesis and antitumor immunity by inhibiting Bcl-2, VEGF-A and IL-17 expression in multiple myeloma.","miRNAs have been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of many cancers. In this article, we investigated the role and the mechanisms of miR-15a/16 in the pathogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). We found that miR-15a/16 was down-regulated in bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) of newly diagnosed patients with MM and the downregulation of miR-15a/16 was correlated with International Staging System (ISS) stage. We then demonstrated miR-15a/16 inhibited myeloma cells proliferation, and increased apoptosis rate of U266 cells by suppressing the expression of anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2. We also found miR-15a/16 could decrease VEGF-A and IL-17 levels in the supernatant of myeloma cells. These results indicate that miR-15a/16 may function as a tumor suppressor in MM through multiple regulatory mechanisms and they may be potential targets for the therapy of MM.",Leukemia research
4,[Growth Inhibition of Multiple Myeloma Cells Caused by MicroRNA-15a and Its Mechanisms].,"Objective: To explore the effect and possible mechanisms of miR-15a on growth of multiple myeloma(MM) cells. Methods: MM cell lines (U266 and RPMI8226) were transfected by lentiviral particles. MM stable cell lines were selected and collected by flow cytometry (FCM). Proliferation of MM cells before and after miR-15a high expression was detected by CCK-8 method. Apoptosis of MM cells before and after miR-15a high expression was detected by AO/EB dying, Hoechst 33258 dying and FCM, respectively. Cell cycle of MM cells before and after miR-15a high expression was detected by FCM. The expressions of miR-15a, BMI-1 and BCL-2 mRNA of MM cells before and after miR-15a high expression were detected by real-time PCR. The expressions of BMI-1 protein of MM cells before and after miR-15a high expression were detected by Western blot. Results: MM stable cell lines with miR-15a high expression was acquired. CCK-8 result showed that high expression of miR-15a could inhibit growth of MM cells (U266 and RPMI8226). AO/EB dying, Hoechst 33258 dying and FCM testing results showed that high expression of miR-15a could significantly induce apoptosis of MM cells (U266 and RPMI8226). The apoptosis rates of U266 and RPMI8226 cells in high expression group and control group were 90.52% vs 37.08% and 59.40% vs 44.17%, respectively. Meanwhile, FCM testing results showed that high expression of miR-15a could induce G1 arrest of MM cells (U266 and RPMI8226), which proportion of G1 phase were 41.50%±0.64%, 45.31%±0.77%, respectively. Real-time PCR results showed that during the growth inhibition process of MM cells caused by miR-15a high expression, the expression of BCL-2 mRNA decreased, but there was no significant changes in the expression of BMI-1 mRNA, while the expression of BMI-1 protein decreased significantly. Conclusion: High expression of miR-15a can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of MM cells, then inhibit their growth. The mechanisms may be related with the negative regulation of BMI-1 and BCL-2 genes in post-transcription level caused by miR-15a.",Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi
5,The emerging role of exosomes in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM), one of the most prevalent hematological malignancies, accounts for approximately 10% of all blood cancers. In spite of the recent advancements in MM therapy, this malignancy of terminally differentiated plasma cells (PCs) continues to remain a hard-to-cure disease due to the emergence of drug resistance and frequent relapses. It is now well-established that the tumor-supportive involvement of the bone marrow microenvironment (BMM) including the cellular and non-cellular elements are the major causes behind treatment failures of MM as well as its main complications such as osteolytic bone loss. Exosomes (EXs) are membranous structures that carry signaling molecules and have recently received a great deal of attention as important mediators of inter-cellular communication in health and disease. EXs involve in the growth and drug resistance of many tumors via delivering their rich contents of bioactive molecules including miRNAs, growth factors, cytokines, signaling molecules, etc. With regard to MM, many studies have reported that EXs are among the main culprits playing key roles in the vicious network within the BMM of these patients. The main producers of EXs that largely contribute to MM pathogenesis are bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) as well as MM cells themselves. These cell types produce large amounts of EXs that affect a variety of target cells including natural killer (NK) cells, osteoclasts (OCs) and osteoblasts (OBs) to the advantage of tumor survival and progression. These EXs contain a different profile of proteins and miRNAs from that of EXs obtained from their counterparts in healthy individuals. MM patients exhibit distinguishable elevations in some of their contents such as miR-21, miR-146a, let-7b and miR-18a, while some molecules like miR-15a are markedly downregulated in EXs of MM patients compared to healthy individuals. These findings make EXs desirable biomarkers for early prediction of disease progression and drug resistance in the context of MM. On the other hand, due to the tumor-supportive role of EXs, targeting these structures in parallel to the conventional therapeutic regimens may be a promising approach to a successful anti-MM therapy. In the present work, an extensive review of the literature has been carried out to highlight the recent advances in the field.",Blood reviews
6,Downregulation of miRNA-15a and miRNA-16 promote tumor proliferation in multiple myeloma by increasing CABIN1 expression.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant disorder characterized by the neoplastic growth of plasma cells in the bone marrow. MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) modulate key regulatory cell pathways via their influence on target genes, and may serve a crucial function in tumorigenesis. Previous studies have indicated that the downregulation of miR-15a and miR-16 contributes to MM pathogenesis. However, the functional mechanisms of miR-15a and miR-16 in MM remain unclear. In the present study, potential target sites for miR-15a and miR-16 were identified on the calcineurin-binding protein 1 (CABIN1) mRNA sequence from analyses of previously published crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids data. Again-of-function study was also performed, which determined that miR-15a/16 directly targeted CABIN1 mRNA and negatively regulated the expression of CABIN1 at the mRNA and protein level in MM cells. A cell proliferation assay demonstrated that the upregulation of miR-15a and miR-16 inhibited the proliferation of MM cells via targeting CABIN1. miR-15a and miR-16 were significantly decreased in MM specimens, compared with in normal specimens, whereas CABIN1 mRNA levels were significantly higher in MM samples compared with in normal samples. CABIN1 mRNA levels were negatively correlated with miR-15a and miR-16 expression levels in MM tissues, as determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis. The results of the present study indicate that the downregulation of miR-15a and miR-16 promotes tumor proliferation in MM by increasing CABIN1 expression. The present study may aid elucidation of the functions of miR-15a and miR-16 and their function in MM carcinogenesis.",Oncology letters
7,MiR-16 regulates crosstalk in NF-kappaB tolerogenic inflammatory signaling between myeloma cells and bone marrow macrophages.,"High levels of circulating miR-16 in the serum of multiple myeloma (MM) patients are independently associated with longer survival. Although the tumor suppressor function of intracellular miR-16 in MM plasma cells (PCs) has been elucidated, its extracellular role in maintaining a nonsupportive cancer microenvironment has not been fully explored. Here, we show that miR-16 is abundantly released by MM cells through extracellular vesicles (EVs) and that differences in its intracellular expression as associated with chromosome 13 deletion (Del13) are correlated to extracellular miR-16 levels. We also demonstrate that EVs isolated from MM patients and from the conditioned media of MM-PCs carrying Del13 more strongly differentiate circulating monocytes to M2-tumor supportive macrophages (TAMs), compared with MM-PCs without this chromosomal aberration. Mechanistically, our data show that miR-16 directly targets the IKKα/β complex of the NF-κB canonical pathway, which is critical not only in supporting MM cell growth, but also in polarizing macrophages toward an M2 phenotype. By using a miR-15a-16-1-KO mouse model, we found that loss of the miR-16 cluster supports polarization to M2 macrophages. Finally, we demonstrate the therapeutic benefit of miR-16 overexpression in potentiating the anti-MM activity by a proteasome inhibitor in the presence of MM-resident bone marrow TAM.",JCI insight
8,miR-15a and miR-16 affect the angiogenesis of multiple myeloma by targeting VEGF.,"Deregulated microRNAs (miRNAs) and their roles in cancer development have attracted much attention. Two miRNAs, miR-15a and miR-16, which act as putative tumor suppressor by targeting the oncogene BCL2, have been implicated in cell cycle, apoptosis and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the possible role of miR-15a/16 in the angiogenesis of multiple myeloma (MM). Using a stem-loop quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, we analyzed miR-15a/16 expressions in bone marrow samples from newly diagnosed MM patients and a panel of MM cell lines. miRNA transfection, western blotting analysis and assay of luciferase activity were used to examine whether vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the target of miR-15a/16. The functional roles of miR-15a/16 on tumorigenesis and angiogenesis were examined by in vitro angiogenesis models and in vivo tumor xenograft model. We showed that miR-15a and miR-16 were significantly underexpressed in primary MM cells as well as in MM cell lines. The aberrant expression of miR-15a/16 was detected especially in advanced stage MM. In human MM cell lines and normal plasma cells, expression of miR-15a/16 inversely correlated with the expression of VEGF-A. Western blotting combined with the luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that VEGF-A was a direct target of miR-15a/16. Ectopic overexpression of miR-15a/16 led to decreased pro-angiogenic activity of MM cells. Finally, infection of lentivirus-miR-15a or lentivirus-miR-16 resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis in nude mice. This study suggest that miR-15a/16 could play a role in the tumorigenesis of MM at least in part by modulation of angiogenesis through targeting VEGF-A.",Carcinogenesis
9,MiRNAs with prognostic significance in multiple myeloma: A systemic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell malignancy associated with hypercalcemia, bone lesions, and renal failure. The prognostic significance of the mutation of miRNAs, one kind of small noncoding RNA molecules that can modulate gene expression, should be confirmed in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This study aimed to identify the prognostic value of miRNAs in patients with MM. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the associations between levels of miRNA expression (predictive factors) and outcomes in patients with MM. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (final search conducted January 1, 2018) to identify eligible studies. Eligible studies were included by certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, whose quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: After performing the literature search and review, 10 relevant studies, including 1214 cases, were identified. The results of our meta-analysis revealed that upregulated miR-92a level and downregulated miR-16, miR-25, miR-744, miR-15a, let-7e, and miR-19b expression were associated with poor prognosis in MM. Conclusions: This study identified miRNAs could serve as potential prognostic biomarkers in MM. Given the limited research available, the clinical application of these findings has yet to be verified.",Medicine

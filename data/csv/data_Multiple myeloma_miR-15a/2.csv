0,Circulating miRNAs as diagnostic biomarkers for multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.,"Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is still an incurable hematological malignancy evolved from asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). New evidence suggests that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can serve as stable diagnostic biomarkers for MM and MUGS. Methods: Serum miRNAs in MM patients, MUGS patients, and healthy controls (HC) were performed by Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. MicroRNAs in MM detected as promising biomarkers were validated by using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and multivariate logistic analysis were used to evaluate the diagnostic value of miRNAs for MM and MUGS. Results: In microarray analysis, the top ten differential expressed miRNAs in MM included miR-134-5p, miR-107, miR-15a-5p, miR-5159-3p, miR-1914-3p, miR-4723-3p, miR-5588-3p, miR-6893-3p, miR-7106-3p, and miR-6722-5p. Three up-regulated miRNAs (miR-134-5p, miR-107, and miR-15a-5p) were further validated. The elevated expression levels of miR-134-5p, miR-107, and miR-15a-5p in qRT-PCR were increased consistent with microarray analysis. These miRNAs distinguished MM and MUGS from HC significantly. Multivariate logistic analysis showed combination miR-107, miR-15a-5p with Hb, the AUC was 0.954 (95% CI: 0.890-1.000), sensitivity of 91.3%, and specificity of 93.7% for distinguishing MM from MUGS. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that miR-134-5p, miR-107, and miR-15a-5p are potential diagnostic biomarkers in MM and MUGS. Moreover, the combination miR-107 and miR-15a-5p with Hb can distinguish MM from MUGS.",Journal of clinical laboratory analysis
1,MicroRNA-15a/16-1 cluster located at chromosome 13q14 is down-regulated but displays different expression pattern and prognostic significance in multiple myeloma.,"MiRNA-15a/16-1 cluster located at chromosome 13q14 has been confirmed to regulate critical genes associated with cell proliferation, apoptosis and drug resistance in multiple myeloma (MM). However, little is known about their expression pattern and prognostic value in MM patients. In this study, we have analyzed the expression levels of miR-15a/16-1 in 117 MM patients (90 newly diagnosed, 11 relapsed and 16 remission patients) and 19 health donors (HDs) by quantitative real-time PCR. Our results indicated that the expression levels of miR-15a and 16-1 were down-regulated in newly diagnosed MM patients as compared to HDs (P = 0.025; P < 0.001) and independent of del(13q14). Downregulation of miR-15a was significantly associated with disease progression and poor prognosis while miR-16-1 seemed to be a good diagnostic marker to distinguish MM from HDs with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.864, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 73%. Furthermore, patients with miR-15a < 2.35 (low expression group) had significantly shorter PFS (P < 0.001) and OS (P < 0.001). After adjustment of the established prognostic variables including del(13q), del(17p), amp(1q21) and high risk genetic abnormality, low miR-15a expression (<2.35) was still a powerful independent predictor for PFS (P = 0.008) and OS (P = 0.038). In addition, miR-15a combined with high β2-MG and high risk genetic abnormality can further identify the high-risk subpopulations. Therefore, our data suggest that the expression patterns of miR-15a/16-1 are different in MM patients, and miR-15a seems to be linked with disease progression and prognosis while miR-16-1 acts as a valuable diagnostic marker.",Oncotarget
2,"MiR-15a, miR-16-1 and miR-17-92 cluster expression are linked to poor prognosis in multiple myeloma.","Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a profound genomic instability of potential prognostic relevance. Loss of chromosome 13, observed in almost half of patients, negatively affects prognosis. MiR-15a, miR16-1 and miR-17-92 cluster, located on 13q, play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Therefore, we investigated a possible correlation of miRNA expression with chromosome 13 deletions (del(13)) and prognosis. We measured the expression of miR-15a, miR16-1 in 70 newly diagnosed MM patients and miR-17-92 cluster in 85 newly diagnosed MM patients by quantitative real-time PCR analyses. MiR-15a, miR-16-1 and miR-17-92 cluster expression levels are independent of the del(13). High levels of miR-15a, miR-16-1, miR-17, miR-20a and miR-92-1 are associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS), suggesting poor prognosis. Our data suggest that the expression of specific miRNAs may be contributing to MM prognosis.",Leukemia research
3,miR-15a and miR-16-1 inhibit the proliferation of leukemic cells by down-regulating WT1 protein level.,"Background: miR-15a and miR-16-1(miR-15a/16-1) have been implicated as tumor suppressors in chronic lymphocytic leukemia, multiple myeloma, and acute myeloid leukemic cells. However the mechanism of inhibiting the proliferation of leukemic cells is poorly understood. Methods: K562 and HL-60 cells were transfected with pRS-15/16 or pRS-E, cell growth were measured by CCK-8 assay and direct cell count. Meanwhile WT1 protein and mRNA level were measured by Western blotting and quantitative real-time PCR. Results: In this study we found that over-expression of miR-15a/16-1 significantly inhibited K562 and HL-60 cells proliferation. Enforced expression of miR-15a/16-1 in K562 and HL-60 cells significantly reduced the protein level of WT1 but not affected the mRNA level. However enforced expression of miR-15a/16-1 can not reduce the activity of a luciferase reporter carrying the 3'-untranslated region(3'UTR) of WT1. Silencing of WT1 by specific siRNA suppressed leukemic cells proliferation resembling that of miR-15a/16-1 over-expression. Anti-miR-15a/16-1 oligonucleotides (AMO) reversed the expression of WT1 in K562 and HL-60 cells. Finally, we found a significant inverse correlation between miR-15a or miR-16-1 expression and WT1 protein levels in primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts and normal controls. Conclusions: These data suggest that miR-15a/16-1 may function as a tumor suppressor to regulate leukemic cell proliferation potentially by down-regulating the WT1 oncogene. However WT1 is not directly targeted by miR-15a/16-1 through miRNA-mRNA base pairing, therefore more study are required to understand the mechanism by which miR-15a/16-1 downregulate WT1.",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR
4,[Role of Exosomal miRNA in Multiple Myeloma Progression and Its Possible Mechanism -Review].,"Multiple myeloma (MM)is a kind of plasma tumor originated from B cell line. Its incidence ranks in second place of hematopoietic malignancies. Although continued progress was made in treatment of MM,the survival rate and prognosis of MM patients are still not satisfactory. Further understanding of the pathogenesis of MM may provide information to develop new treatment strategies, so as to improve survival rate and ameliorate its prognosis. Many researches have demonstrated that bone marrow microenvironment plays an important role in MM pathogenesis, which regulates the biological properties of MM cells, including migration and proliferation, through miRNA, mRNA and protein contained in the exosomes released from the cells in the tumor microenvironment. Recently, as the tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes, exosomal microRNA become a hot spot in research. Compared with those of the normal ones, exosomes in MM have less miR-15a and/or more miR-135b and miR-21. These differences will accelerate the progression of MM via PI3K/Akt/eNOS/VEGF pathway, FIH-HIF pathway, MAPK/ERK/Ras pathway and so on, that are expected to become the new targets for the treatment of MM. This review summarizes the role and the possible mechanism of exosomes in the progression of MM.",Zhongguo shi yan xue ye xue za zhi
5,"The ceramide pathway is involved in the survival, apoptosis and exosome functions of human multiple myeloma cells in vitro.","Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells and refractoriness to traditional therapies. It has been shown that exosomes are involved in modulating the progression and the metastasis of cancers through microRNAs (miRs). Ceramide is a type of sphingolipid; the ceramide pathway of exosomal secretion has been shown to affect the apoptosis of cancer cells. But the role of this pathway in MM cell function, exosome function and miR regulation remains unknown. In this study, we showed that C6 ceramide (an exogenous ceramide supplement, 1.25-40 μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation and promoted the apoptosis in human MM OPM2 cell line, which were associated with elevated caspase 3/9 and PARP cleavage. We also found that C6 ceramide (5-20 μmol/L) dose-dependently stimulated exosome secretion and increased exosomal levels of tumor-suppressive miRs (miR 202, miR 16, miR 29b and miR 15a). Of note, exosomes from C6 ceramide-treated OPM2 cells could influence the proliferation and apoptosis of the recipient OPM2 cells, which correlated with increased tumor-suppressive exosomal miRs. In contrast, GW4869 (a ceramide inhibitor, 5-20 μmol/L) exerted the opposite effects on the regulation of MM function, exosome secretion and miR levels in MM exosomes. However, exosomes from GW4869-treated OPM2 cells had no effect on these miRs and the survival of targeted OPM2 cells. Taken together, our findings reveal that the ceramide pathway modulates MM survival, probably directly via the caspase pathway and indirectly via exosomal miR mechanisms.",Acta pharmacologica Sinica
6,Potential role of exosome-associated microRNA panels and in vivo environment to predict drug resistance for patients with multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic neoplasms and an appropriate in vivo environment for myeloma cells has potential implications for initiation, progression, and metastasis of MM. Exosomes, entities carrying microRNAs (miRNAs) to target locations, participate in the cross-talk between myeloma cells and nonmalignant components of the in vivo environment. This study disclosed the emerging roles of circulating exosome-associated miRNAs in drug resistance (DR) of MM. To this end, the medical records of consecutively hospitalized MM patients, who received novel agents-based therapies, were analyzed. Then, an optimized procedure was established for exosome isolation and exosomal RNA analysis. The exosome-associated miRNA expression patterns for predicting bortezomib (Bz) resistance of MM were further examined using a microarray. In total, 204 patients were enrolled with DR rates of 36.5%, 73.1% and 81.8% in the bortezomib (Bz), thalidomide and lenalidomide containing groups. The serum total light chain ratio ≥ 100, CRP ≥ 20 mg/L, and the second-line usage increased risks of acquired Bz-resistance. Among 68 cases having genetic tests, a high risk factor for predicting de novo DR was 1q21 amplification, which also correlated with lower levels of cholesterol and LDL-C. Moreover, nano-sized exosomes were isolated with significantly increasing internal RNAs and down-regulation of exosomal miR-16-5p, miR-15a-5p and miR-20a-5p, miR-17-5p was revealed in the patients resistant to Bz. The routine workup of MM hardly suggested a value for DR prediction. The circulating exosomes carrying miRNAs provided a window that permits a better understanding of the in vivo intercellular crosstalk in MM patients.",Oncotarget
7,[Potential relationship and clinical significance of miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines in patients with multiple myeloma].,"Objective: To explore the expression and significance of miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Methods: A total of 27 MM patients and 8 health controls were enrolled in this study. The expression of miR-15a/16,miR-34a,miR-194-2-192 cluster and miR-181a/b in bone marrow were detected by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine the levels of Th17 related cytokines interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-21, IL-22, IL-23 and IL-27 in peripheral blood plasma. The role of miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines was analyzed in the development of MM. Results: The expression of miR-15a/16,miR-34a,miR-194-2-192 cluster in MM patients were significantly lower than those of the health controls, while miR-181a/b were exactly the reverse (P<0.05). The levels of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 were up-regulated in MM patients compared to health controls while IL-22 was down-regulated (P<0.05). There was no significant difference of IL-23 between the two groups. The levels of miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines had associated with ISS but not with some clinical parameters (such as gender, age, disease classification). Higher expression of IL-17, IL-21, IL-23, IL-27, miR-181a/b and lower expression of miR-15a/16,miR-34a,miR-194 and IL-22 were observed in the end stage than the early stage of MM patients (P<0.05). There was a significant correlation between miRNAs and Th17 related cytokines. Conclusion: Up-regulated IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 may potentially down-regulate the expression of several miRNAs in MM patients. Establishment of the relationship may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of MM and for clinical diagnosis of the disease.",Zhonghua xue ye xue za zhi = Zhonghua xueyexue zazhi
8,Exosome-transmitted LINC00461 promotes multiple myeloma cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis by modulating microRNA/BCL-2 expression.,"Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a hematologic cancer caused by the abnormal expansion of plasma cells, but the exact mechanism underlying MM development is not completely known. Recently, multiple long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were implicated in the regulation of MM development. Methods: Samples from patients with MM were collected and detected for LINC00461 expression using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). LINC00461 was knocked down in MM cell lines by short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) to measure its effect on MM cell proliferation and apoptosis. The function of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-derived exosomes was analyzed using chamber assays. Results: LINC00461 was highly expressed in MM. Knockdown of LINC00461 dramatically reduced MM cell proliferation and induced cell apoptosis. Further study showed that LINC00461 relieved the inhibitory effect of microRNA (miR)-15a/miR-16 on BCL-2. In addition, we observed that MSC-derived exosomes promoted MM cell proliferation through LINC00461. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate that LINC00461, a sponge for miR-15a/16, is highly expressed in MSC-derived exosomes, and enhances MM cell proliferation, which may become an excellent candidate for therapeutic applications.",Cytotherapy
9,Altered Expression of MicroRNAs in the Bone Marrow of Multiple Myeloma Patients and their Relationship to Cytogenetic Aberrations.,"Background: Multiple Myeloma (MM) is a complex hematologic malignancy, driven by several genetic and epigenetic alterations. MiRNAs as biomarkers have become a rapidly growing research area in the last decade. Aim: The aim was to study the expression pattern of selected miRNAs and to explore the impact of cytogenetic aberrations in MM patients for therapeutic tools. Patients and methods: Forty Egyptian adult patients were selected for the study with symptomatic newly diagnosed MM disease. Bone marrow samples were collected to investigate twelve miRNAs selected according to their relation to the most common cytogenetic aberrations with relevant prognostic value. The relative expression of the selected miRNAs was determined using a real-time PCR technique. Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique was performed for cytogenetic analysis. Results: Eight miRNAs were down-regulated [miR-15a (p<0.001), miR214-3p (p<0.001), miR135b (p<0.001), miR19a-3p (p<0.001), miR19b-3p ((p=0.026), miR30e-5p (NS), miR133a (NS), miR146a- 5p (p<0.001)]. Four miRNAs were up-regulated [miR99b-5p (p=0.028), miR125a-3p (p=0.004), let7b- 5p (p<0.001), let7c-5p (p<0.001)]. Significant relation was observed between positive 14q32 rearrangement using the break apart re-arrangement probe for 14q32.33 locus and lower expression levels of miR15a (p= 0.014), 214-3p (p=0.046), 99b-5p (p=0.014), 146a-5p (p=0.041). A higher expression level of miR30e-5p was significantly related to positive 14q32 rearrangement. Conclusion: Deregulated miRNAs were identified and the association with 14q32 rearrangement and MM pathogenesis has been determined.",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology

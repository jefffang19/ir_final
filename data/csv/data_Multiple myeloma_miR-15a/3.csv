0,"DLEU2, frequently deleted in malignancy, functions as a critical host gene of the cell cycle inhibitory microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1.","The microRNAs miR-15a and miR-16-1 are downregulated in multiple tumor types and are frequently deleted in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma. Despite their abundance in most cells the transcriptional regulation of miR-15a/16-1 remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that the putative tumor suppressor DLEU2 acts as a host gene of these microRNAs. Mature miR-15a/miR-16-1 are produced in a Drosha-dependent process from DLEU2 and binding of the Myc oncoprotein to two alterative DLEU2 promoters represses both the host gene transcript and levels of mature miR-15a/miR-16-1. In line with a functional role for DLEU2 in the expression of the microRNAs, the miR-15a/miR-16-1 locus is retained in four CLL cases that delete both promoters of this gene and expression analysis indicates that this leads to functional loss of mature miR-15a/16-1. We additionally show that DLEU2 negatively regulates the G1 Cyclins E1 and D1 through miR-15a/miR-16-1 and provide evidence that these oncoproteins are subject to miR-15a/miR-16-1-mediated repression under normal conditions. We also demonstrate that DLEU2 overexpression blocks cellular proliferation and inhibits the colony-forming ability of tumor cell lines in a miR-15a/miR-16-1-dependent way. Together the data illuminate how inactivation of DLEU2 promotes cell proliferation and tumor progression through functional loss of miR-15a/miR-16-1.",Experimental cell research
1,Potential relationship and clinical significance of miRNAs and Th17 cytokines in patients with multiple myeloma.,"We evaluated the potential relationship between miRNAs and Th17 cytokines in multiple myeloma (MM) patients. Twenty-seven newly diagnosed myeloma patients and eight normal donors were studied. We determined that the relative expression levels of miR-15a/16, miR-34a, miR-194 in MM patients were significantly lower than those in the healthy controls with exception for miR-181a/b, which showed significantly higher in MM patients (P<0.05). In contrast, the levels of IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 were up-regulated in MM patients compared to healthy controls while IL-22 was down-regulated (P<0.05). The expression patterns of them were differentially present in various groups according to the International Staging System (ISS) criteria. Up-regulated IL-17, IL-21 and IL-27 may potentially down-regulate the expression of several miRNAs in MM patients. Establishment of the relationship may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of MM and for clinical diagnosis of the disease.",Leukemia research
2,Micro-RNA-15a and micro-RNA-16 expression and chromosome 13 deletions in multiple myeloma.,"We have used copy number variation (CNV) analysis with SNP mapping arrays for miRNA-15a and miRNA-16-1 expression analysis in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) with or without deletion of chromosome 13q14. MiRNA-15a and miRNA-16 display a range of expression patterns in MM patients, independent of the chromosome 13 status. These findings suggest that genes other than miR-15a and miR-16 may explain the prognostic significance of 13q14 deletions.",Leukemia research
3,"Micro-RNAs, New performers in multiple myeloma bone marrow microenvironment.","The established interaction between multiple myeloma cells and bone marrow microenvironment components provides malignant cells with various survival, growth and drug resistance signals. As a new concept, identification of miRNAs and their related gene/protein targets, signaling molecules and pathways in the context of bone marrow microenvironment will help understanding more deeply the pathogenesis of the disease and possible mechanisms underlying environment-induced drug resistance. Recent studies suggest that bone marrow stromal cells can modulate some miRNAs (miR-21, miR-15a/16) in multiple myeloma cells through direct adhesion, cytokine secretion or transfer of miRNA-containing exosomes, however; the specific miRNA targets are not clear. In spite of a remarkable progress in understanding myeloma biology and therapy, the disease persists to be hard to treat. This review will discuss the most recent findings on miRNAs expression and function in the context of bone marrow microenvironment highlighting the miRNAs as potential therapeutic targets in multiple myeloma.",Biomarker research
4,Downregulation of MicroRNA-152 contributes to high expression of DKK1 in multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) induced bone lesion is one of the most crippling characteristics, and the MM secreted Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) has been reported to play important role in this pathologic process. However, the underlying regulation mechanisms involved in DKK1 expression are still unclear. In this study, we validated the expression patterns of microRNA (miR) 15a, 34a, 152, and 223 in MM cells and identified that miR-152 was significantly downregulated in the MM group compared with the non-MM group, and that miR-152 level was negatively correlated with the expression of DKK1 in the MM cells. Mechanistic studies showed that manipulating miR-152 artificially in MM cells led to changes in DKK-1 expression, and miR-152 blocked DKK1 transcriptional activity by binding to the 3'UTR of DKK1 mRNA. Importantly, we revealed that MM cells stably expressing miR-152 improved the chemotherapy sensitivity, and counteracted the bone disruption in an intrabone-MM mouse model. Our study contributes better understanding of the regulation mechanism of DKK-1 in MM, and opens up the potential for developing newer therapeutic strategies in the MM treatment.",RNA biology
5,Regulation of p53-targeting microRNAs by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Implications in the etiology of multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common and deadly cancer of blood plasma cells. A unique feature of MM is the extremely low somatic mutation rate of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, in sharp contrast with about half of all human cancers where this gene is frequently mutated. Eleven miRNAs have been reported to repress p53 through direct interaction with the 3' untranslated region. The expression of nine of them is higher in MM plasma cells than in healthy donor counterparts, suggesting that miRNA overexpression is responsible for p53 inactivation in MM. Here, we report that the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) upregulated the expression of seven p53-targeting miRNAs (miR-25, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-92, miR-125b, miR-141, and miR-200a), while 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin (TCDD) upregulated two of them (miR-25 and miR-92) in MM cells. The miR-25 promoter was activated by both BaP and TCDD, and this response was mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We screened 727 compounds that inhibit MM cell survival and down-regulate the expression of p53-targeting miRNAs. We found that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a constituent of green tea and a major component of the botanical drug Polyphenon® E, reduced the expression of four p53-targeting miRNAs, including miR-25, miR-92, miR-141, and miR-200a. Collectively, these data implicate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and AhR in the regulation of p53-targeting miRNAs in MM and identify a potential therapeutic and preventive agent to combat this deadly disease.",Molecular carcinogenesis
6,BM mesenchymal stromal cell-derived exosomes facilitate multiple myeloma progression.,"BM mesenchymal stromal cells (BM-MSCs) support multiple myeloma (MM) cell growth, but little is known about the putative mechanisms by which the BM microenvironment plays an oncogenic role in this disease. Cell-cell communication is mediated by exosomes. In this study, we showed that MM BM-MSCs release exosomes that are transferred to MM cells, thereby resulting in modulation of tumor growth in vivo. Exosomal microRNA (miR) content differed between MM and normal BM-MSCs, with a lower content of the tumor suppressor miR-15a. In addition, MM BM-MSC-derived exosomes had higher levels of oncogenic proteins, cytokines, and adhesion molecules compared with exosomes from the cells of origin. Importantly, whereas MM BM-MSC-derived exosomes promoted MM tumor growth, normal BM-MSC exosomes inhibited the growth of MM cells. In summary, these in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that exosome transfer from BM-MSCs to clonal plasma cells represents a previously undescribed and unique mechanism that highlights the contribution of BM-MSCs to MM disease progression.",The Journal of clinical investigation

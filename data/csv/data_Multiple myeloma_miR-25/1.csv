0,MiRNAs with prognostic significance in multiple myeloma: A systemic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal plasma cell malignancy associated with hypercalcemia, bone lesions, and renal failure. The prognostic significance of the mutation of miRNAs, one kind of small noncoding RNA molecules that can modulate gene expression, should be confirmed in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). This study aimed to identify the prognostic value of miRNAs in patients with MM. Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals for the associations between levels of miRNA expression (predictive factors) and outcomes in patients with MM. We systematically searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases (final search conducted January 1, 2018) to identify eligible studies. Eligible studies were included by certain inclusion and exclusion criteria, whose quality was assessed by Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Results: After performing the literature search and review, 10 relevant studies, including 1214 cases, were identified. The results of our meta-analysis revealed that upregulated miR-92a level and downregulated miR-16, miR-25, miR-744, miR-15a, let-7e, and miR-19b expression were associated with poor prognosis in MM. Conclusions: This study identified miRNAs could serve as potential prognostic biomarkers in MM. Given the limited research available, the clinical application of these findings has yet to be verified.",Medicine
1,A serum microRNA signature associated with complete remission and progression after autologous stem-cell transplantation in patients with multiple myeloma.,"We have examined serum microRNA expression in multiple myeloma (MM) patients at diagnosis and at complete response (CR) after autologous stem-cell transplantation (ASCT), in patients with stable monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, and in healthy controls. MicroRNAs were first profiled using TaqMan Human MicroRNA Arrays. Differentially expressed microRNAs were then validated by individual TaqMan MicroRNA assays and correlated with CR and progression-free survival (PFS) after ASCT. Supervised analysis identified a differentially expressed 14-microRNA signature. The differential expression of miR-16 (P = 0.028), miR-17 (P = 0.016), miR-19b (P = 0.009), miR-20a (P = 0.017) and miR-660 (P = 0.048) at diagnosis and CR was then confirmed by individual assays. In addition, high levels of miR-25 were related to the presence of oligoclonal bands (P = 0.002). Longer PFS after ASCT was observed in patients with high levels of miR-19b (6 vs. 1.8 years; P < 0.001) or miR-331 (8.6 vs. 2.9 years; P = 0.001). Low expression of both miR-19b and miR-331 in combination was a marker of shorter PFS (HR 5.3; P = 0.033). We have identified a serum microRNA signature with potential as a diagnostic and prognostic tool in MM.",Oncotarget
2,Identification of four potential predicting miRNA biomarkers for multiple myeloma from published datasets.,"Background: Multiple myeloma is a cancer which has a high occurrence rate and causes great injury to people worldwide. In recent years, many studies reported the effects of miRNA on the appearance of multiple myeloma. However, due to the differences of samples and sequencing platforms, a large number of inconsistent results have been generated among these studies, which limited the cure of multiple myeloma at the miRNA level. Methods: We performed meta-analyses to identify the key miRNA biomarkers which could be applied on the treatment of multiple myeloma. The key miRNAs were determined by overlap comparisons of seven datasets in multiple myeloma. Then, the target genes for key miRNAs were predicted by the software TargetScan. Additionally, functional enrichments and binding TFs were investigated by DAVID database and Tfacts database, respectively. Results: Firstly, comparing the normal tissues, 13 miRNAs were differently expressed miRNAs (DEMs) for at least three datasets. They were considered as key miRNAs, with 12 up-regulated (hsa-miR-106b, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-130b, hsa-miR-138, hsa-miR-15b, hsa-miR-181a, hsa-miR-183, hsa-miR-191, hsa-miR-19a, hsa-miR-20a, hsa-miR-221 and hsa-miR-25) and one down-regulated (hsa-miR-223). Secondly, functional enrichment analyses indicated that target genes of the upregulated miRNAs were mainly transcript factors and enriched in transcription regulation. Besides, these genes were enriched in multiple pathways: the cancer signal pathway, insulin signal metabolic pathway, cell binding molecules, melanin generation, long-term regression and P53 signaling pathway. However, no significant enrichment was found for target genes of the down-regulated genes. Due to the distinct regulation function, four miRNAs (hsa-miR-19a has-miR-221 has-miR25 and has-miR223) were ascertained as the potential prognostic and diagnostic markers in MM. Thirdly, transcript factors analysis unveiled that there were 148 TFs and 60 TFs which bind target genes of the up-regulated miRNAs and target genes of the down-regulated miRNAs, respectively. They respectively generated 652 and 139 reactions of TFs and target genes. Additionally, 50 (31.6%) TFs were shared, while higher specificity was found in TFs of target genes for the upregulated miRNAs. Discussions: Together, our findings provided the key miRNAs which affected occurrence of multiple myeloma and regulation function of these miRNAs. It is valuable for the prognosis and diagnosis of multiple myeloma.",PeerJ
3,Regulation of p53-targeting microRNAs by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Implications in the etiology of multiple myeloma.,"Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common and deadly cancer of blood plasma cells. A unique feature of MM is the extremely low somatic mutation rate of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, in sharp contrast with about half of all human cancers where this gene is frequently mutated. Eleven miRNAs have been reported to repress p53 through direct interaction with the 3' untranslated region. The expression of nine of them is higher in MM plasma cells than in healthy donor counterparts, suggesting that miRNA overexpression is responsible for p53 inactivation in MM. Here, we report that the environmental carcinogen benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) upregulated the expression of seven p53-targeting miRNAs (miR-25, miR-15a, miR-16, miR-92, miR-125b, miR-141, and miR-200a), while 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-ρ-dioxin (TCDD) upregulated two of them (miR-25 and miR-92) in MM cells. The miR-25 promoter was activated by both BaP and TCDD, and this response was mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). We screened 727 compounds that inhibit MM cell survival and down-regulate the expression of p53-targeting miRNAs. We found that (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a constituent of green tea and a major component of the botanical drug Polyphenon® E, reduced the expression of four p53-targeting miRNAs, including miR-25, miR-92, miR-141, and miR-200a. Collectively, these data implicate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and AhR in the regulation of p53-targeting miRNAs in MM and identify a potential therapeutic and preventive agent to combat this deadly disease.",Molecular carcinogenesis
4,Negative regulation of the tumor suppressor p53 gene by microRNAs.,"The tumor suppressor p53, encoded by the TP53 gene, is recognized as the guardian of the human genome because it regulates many downstream genes to exercise its function in cell cycle and cell death. Recent studies have revealed that several microRNAs (miRNAs) are important components of the p53 tumor suppressor network with miR-125b and miR-504 directly targeting TP53. In this study, we use a screening method to identify that two miRNAs (miR-25 and miR-30d) directly target the 3'UTR of TP53 to downregulate p53 protein levels and reduce the expression of genes that are transcriptionally activated by p53. Correspondingly, both miR-25 and miR-30d adversely affect apoptotic cell death, cell cycle arrest and cellular senescence. Inhibition of either miR-25 or miR-30d expression increases endogenous p53 expression and elevates cellular apoptosis in several cell lines, including one from multiple myeloma that has little TP53 mutations. Thus, beyond miR-125b and miR-504, the human TP53 gene is negatively regulated by two more miRNAs: miR-25 and miR-30d.",Oncogene

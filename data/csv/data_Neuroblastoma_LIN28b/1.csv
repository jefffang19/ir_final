0,LIN28B regulates transcription and potentiates MYCN-induced neuroblastoma through binding to ZNF143 at target gene promotors.,"LIN28B is highly expressed in neuroblastoma and promotes tumorigenesis, at least, in part, through inhibition of let-7 microRNA biogenesis. Here, we report that overexpression of either wild-type (WT) LIN28B or a LIN28B mutant that is unable to inhibit let-7 processing increases the penetrance of MYCN-induced neuroblastoma, potentiates the invasion and migration of transformed sympathetic neuroblasts, and drives distant metastases in vivo. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively parallel DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) and coimmunoprecipitation experiments show that LIN28B binds active gene promoters in neuroblastoma cells through protein-protein interaction with the sequence-specific zinc-finger transcription factor ZNF143 and activates the expression of downstream targets, including transcription factors forming the adrenergic core regulatory circuitry that controls the malignant cell state in neuroblastoma as well as GSK3B and L1CAM that are involved in neuronal cell adhesion and migration. These findings reveal an unexpected let-7-independent function of LIN28B in transcriptional regulation during neuroblastoma pathogenesis.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
1,LIN28B promotes neuroblastoma metastasis and regulates PDZ binding kinase.,"Neuroblastoma is an aggressive pediatric malignancy of the neural crest with suboptimal cure rates and a striking predilection for widespread metastases, underscoring the need to identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities. We recently identified the RNA binding protein LIN28B as a driver in high-risk neuroblastoma and demonstrated it promotes oncogenic cell proliferation by coordinating a RAN-Aurora kinase A network. Here, we demonstrate that LIN28B influences another key hallmark of cancer, metastatic dissemination. Using a murine xenograft model of neuroblastoma dissemination, we show that LIN28B promotes metastasis. We demonstrate that this is in part due to the effects of LIN28B on self-renewal and migration, providing an understanding of how LIN28B shapes the metastatic phenotype. Our studies reveal that the let-7 family, which LIN28B inhibits, decreases self-renewal and migration. Next, we identify PDZ Binding Kinase (PBK) as a novel LIN28B target. PBK is a serine/threonine kinase that promotes the proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cells and serves as an oncogenic driver in multiple aggressive malignancies. We demonstrate that PBK is both a novel direct target of let-7i and that MYCN regulates PBK expression, thus elucidating two oncogenic drivers that converge on PBK. Functionally, PBK promotes self-renewal and migration, phenocopying LIN28B. Taken together, our findings define a role for LIN28B in neuroblastoma metastasis and define the targetable kinase PBK as a potential novel vulnerability in metastatic neuroblastoma.","Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)"
2,Lin28B and Let-7 in the Control of Sympathetic Neurogenesis and Neuroblastoma Development.,"The RNA binding protein Lin28B is expressed in developing tissues and sustains stem and progenitor cell identity as a negative regulator of the Let-7 family of microRNAs, which induces differentiation. Lin28B is activated in neuroblastoma (NB), a childhood tumor in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla. Forced expression of Lin28B in embryonic mouse sympathoadrenal neuroblasts elicits postnatal NB formation. However, the normal function of Lin28B in the development of sympathetic neurons and chromaffin cells and the mechanisms involved in Lin28B-induced tumor formation are unclear. Here, we demonstrate a mirror-image expression of Lin28B and Let-7a in developing chick sympathetic ganglia. Lin28B expression is not restricted to undifferentiated progenitor cells but, is observed in proliferating noradrenergic neuroblasts. Lin28 knockdown in cultured sympathetic neuroblasts decreases proliferation, whereas Let-7 inhibition increases the proportion of neuroblasts in the cell cycle. Lin28B overexpression enhances proliferation, but only during a short developmental period, and it does not reduce Let-7a. Effects of in vivo Lin28B overexpression were analyzed in the LSL-Lin28B(DBHiCre) mouse line. Sympathetic ganglion and adrenal medulla volume and the expression level of Let-7a were not altered, although Lin28B expression increased by 12- to 17-fold. In contrast, Let-7a expression was strongly reduced in LSL-Lin28B(DbhiCre) NB tumor tissue. These data demonstrate essential functions for endogenous Lin28 and Let-7 in neuroblast proliferation. However, Lin28B overexpression neither sustains neuroblast proliferation nor affects let-7 expression. Thus, in contrast to other pediatric tumors, Lin28B-induced NB is not due to expansion of proliferating embryonic neuroblasts, and Let-7-independent functions are implicated during initial NB development. Significance statement: Lin28A/B proteins are highly expressed in early development and maintain progenitor cells by blocking the biogenesis and differentiation function of Let-7 microRNAs. Lin28B is aberrantly upregulated in the childhood tumor neuroblastoma (NB). NB develops in sympathetic ganglia and adrenal medulla and is elicited by forced Lin28B expression. We demonstrate that Lin28A/B and Let-7 are essential for sympathetic neuroblast proliferation during normal development. Unexpectedly, Lin28B upregulation in a mouse model does not affect neuroblast proliferation, ganglion size, and Let-7 expression during early postnatal development. Lin28B-induced NB, in contrast to other pediatric cancers, does not evolve from neuroblasts that continue to divide and involves Let-7-independent functions during initial development.",The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience
3,Genetic predisposition and chromosome instability in neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is a pediatric tumor of embryonic origin. About 1-2% of all NBs are familial cases, and genetic predisposition is suspected for the remaining cases. During the last decade, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and high-throughput sequencing approaches have been used to identify associations among common and rare genetic variants and NB risk. Substantial data has been produced by large patient cohorts that implicate various genes in NB tumorigenesis, such as CASC15, BARD1, CHEK2, LMO1, LIN28B, AXIN2, BRCA1, TP53, SMARCA4, and CDK1NB. NB, as well as other pediatric cancers, has few recurrent mutations but several copy number variations (CNVs). Almost all NBs show both numerical and structural CNVs. The proportion between numerical and structural CNVs differs between localized and metastatic tumors, with a greater prevalence of structural CNVs in metastatic NB. This genomic chaos frequently identified in NBs suggests that chromosome instability (CIN) could be one of the major actors in NB oncogenesis. Interestingly, many NB-predisposing variants occur in genes involved in the control of genome stability, mitosis, and normal chromosome separation. Here, we discuss the relationship between genetic predisposition and CIN in NB.",Cancer metastasis reviews
4,Lin28B and miR-142-3p regulate neuronal differentiation by modulating Staufen1 expression.,"Staufen1 (STAU1) and Lin28B are RNA-binding proteins that are involved in neuronal differentiation as a function of post-transcriptional regulation. STAU1 triggers post-transcriptional regulation, including mRNA export, mRNA relocation, translation and mRNA decay. Lin28B also has multiple functions in miRNA biogenesis and the regulation of translation. Here, we examined the connection between STAU1 and Lin28B and found that Lin28B regulates the abundance of STAU1 mRNA via miRNA maturation. Decreases in the expression of both STAU1 and Lin28B were observed during neuronal differentiation. Depletion of STAU1 or Lin28B inhibited neuronal differentiation, and overexpression of STAU1 or Lin28B enhanced neuronal differentiation. Interestingly, the stability of STAU1 mRNA was modulated by miR-142-3p, whose maturation was regulated by Lin28B. Thus, miR-142-3p expression increased as Lin28B expression decreased during differentiation, leading to the reduction of STAU1 expression. The transcriptome from Staufen-mediated mRNA decay (SMD) targets during differentiation was analyzed, confirming that STAU1 was a key factor in neuronal differentiation. In support of this finding, regulation of STAU1 expression in mouse neural precursor cells had the same effects on neuronal differentiation as it did in human neuroblastoma cells. These results revealed the collaboration of two RNA-binding proteins, STAU1 and Lin28B, as a regulatory mechanism in neuronal differentiation.",Cell death and differentiation
5,Molecular targeting therapies for neuroblastoma: Progress and challenges.,"There is an urgent need to identify novel therapies for childhood cancers. Neuroblastoma is the most common pediatric solid tumor, and accounts for ~15% of childhood cancer-related mortality. Neuroblastomas exhibit genetic, morphological and clinical heterogeneity, which limits the efficacy of existing treatment modalities. Gaining detailed knowledge of the molecular signatures and genetic variations involved in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma is necessary to develop safer and more effective treatments for this devastating disease. Recent studies with advanced high-throughput ""omics"" techniques have revealed numerous genetic/genomic alterations and dysfunctional pathways that drive the onset, growth, progression, and resistance of neuroblastoma to therapy. A variety of molecular signatures are being evaluated to better understand the disease, with many of them being used as targets to develop new treatments for neuroblastoma patients. In this review, we have summarized the contemporary understanding of the molecular pathways and genetic aberrations, such as those in MYCN, BIRC5, PHOX2B, and LIN28B, involved in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma, and provide a comprehensive overview of the molecular targeted therapies under preclinical and clinical investigations, particularly those targeting ALK signaling, MDM2, PI3K/Akt/mTOR and RAS-MAPK pathways, as well as epigenetic regulators. We also give insights on the use of combination therapies involving novel agents that target various pathways. Further, we discuss the future directions that would help identify novel targets and therapeutics and improve the currently available therapies, enhancing the treatment outcomes and survival of patients with neuroblastoma.",Medicinal research reviews
6,"The mutational landscape of MYCN, Lin28b and ALK(F1174L) driven murine neuroblastoma mimics human disease.","Genetically engineered mouse models have proven to be essential tools for unraveling fundamental aspects of cancer biology and for testing novel therapeutic strategies. To optimally serve these goals, it is essential that the mouse model faithfully recapitulates the human disease. Recently, novel mouse models for neuroblastoma have been developed. Here, we report on the further genomic characterization through exome sequencing and DNA copy number analysis of four of the currently available murine neuroblastoma model systems (ALK, Th-MYCN, Dbh-MYCN and Lin28b). The murine tumors revealed a low number of genomic alterations - in keeping with human neuroblastoma - and a positive correlation of the number of genetic lesions with the time to onset of tumor formation was observed. Gene copy number alterations are the hallmark of both murine and human disease and frequently affect syntenic genomic regions. Despite low mutational load, the genes mutated in murine disease were found to be enriched for genes mutated in human disease. Taken together, our study further supports the validity of the tested mouse models for mechanistic and preclinical studies of human neuroblastoma.",Oncotarget
7,Genomic coamplification of CDK4/MDM2/FRS2 is associated with very poor prognosis and atypical clinical features in neuroblastoma patients.,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extracranial malignant tumor of childhood and is characterized by a broad heterogeneity in clinical presentation and evolution. Recent advances in pangenomic analysis of NB have revealed different recurrent chromosomal aberrations. Indeed, it is now well established that the overall genomic profile is important for treatment stratification. In previous studies, 11 genes were shown to be recurrently amplified (ODC1, ALK, GREB1, NTSR2, LIN28B, MDM2, CDK4, MYEOV, CCND1, TERT, and MYC) besides MYCN, with poor survival of NB patients harboring these amplifications being suggested. Genomic profiles of 628 NB samples analyzed by array-comparative genome hybridization (a-CGH) were re-examined to identify gene amplifications other them MYCN amplification. Clinical data were retrospectively collected. We additionally evaluated the association of FRS2 gene expression with NB patient outcome using the public R2 Platform. We found eight NB samples with high grade amplification of one or two loci on chromosome arm 12q. The regional amplifications were located on bands 12q13.3-q14.1 and 12q15-q21.1 involving the genes CDK4, MDM2, and the potential oncogenic gene FRS2. The CDK4, MDM2, and FRS2 loci were coamplified in 8/8 samples. The 12q amplifications were associated with very poor prognosis and atypical clinical features of NB patients. Further functional and clinical investigations are needed to confirm or refute these associations.","Genes, chromosomes & cancer"
8,MYCN-driven regulatory mechanisms controlling LIN28B in neuroblastoma.,"LIN28B has been identified as an oncogene in various tumor entities, including neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer that originates from neural crest-derived cells, and is characterized by amplification of the MYCN oncogene. Recently, elevated LIN28B expression levels were shown to contribute to neuroblastoma tumorigenesis via let-7 dependent de-repression of MYCN. However, additional insight in the regulation of LIN28B in neuroblastoma is lacking. Therefore, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of the regulation of LIN28B in neuroblastoma, with a specific focus on the contribution of miRNAs. We show that MYCN regulates LIN28B expression in neuroblastoma tumors via two distinct parallel mechanisms. First, through an unbiased LIN28B-3'UTR reporter screen, we found that miR-26a-5p and miR-26b-5p regulate LIN28B expression. Next, we demonstrated that MYCN indirectly affects the expression of miR-26a-5p, and hence regulates LIN28B, therefore establishing an MYCN-miR-26a-5p-LIN28B regulatory axis. Second, we provide evidence that MYCN regulates LIN28B expression via interaction with the LIN28B promoter, establishing a direct MYCN-LIN28B regulatory axis. We believe that these findings mark LIN28B as an important effector of the MYCN oncogenic phenotype and underline the importance of MYCN-regulated miRNAs in establishing the MYCN-driven oncogenic process.",Cancer letters
9,LIN28B increases neural crest cell migration and leads to transformation of trunk sympathoadrenal precursors.,"The RNA-binding protein LIN28B regulates developmental timing and determines stem cell identity by suppressing the let-7 family of microRNAs. Postembryonic reactivation of LIN28B impairs cell commitment to differentiation, prompting their transformation. In this study, we assessed the extent to which ectopic lin28b expression modulates the physiological behavior of neural crest cells (NCC) and governs their transformation in the trunk region of developing embryos. We provide evidence that the overexpression of lin28b inhibits sympathoadrenal cell differentiation and accelerates NCC migration in two vertebrate models, Xenopus leavis and Danio rerio. Our results highlight the relevance of ITGA5 and ITGA6 in the LIN28B-dependent regulation of the invasive motility of tumor cells. The results also establish that LIN28B overexpression supports neuroblastoma onset and the metastatic potential of malignant cells through let-7a-dependent and let-7a-independent mechanisms.",Cell death and differentiation

0,A LIN28B-RAN-AURKA Signaling Network Promotes Neuroblastoma Tumorigenesis.,"A more complete understanding of aberrant oncogenic signaling in neuroblastoma, a malignancy of the developing sympathetic nervous system, is paramount to improving patient outcomes. Recently, we identified LIN28B as an oncogenic driver in high-risk neuroblastoma. Here, we identify the oncogene RAN as a LIN28B target and show regional gain of chromosome 12q24 as an additional somatic alteration resulting in increased RAN expression. We show that LIN28B influences RAN expression by promoting RAN Binding Protein 2 expression and by directly binding RAN mRNA. Further, we demonstrate a convergence of LIN28B and RAN signaling on Aurora kinase A activity. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that LIN28B-RAN-AURKA signaling drives neuroblastoma oncogenesis, suggesting that this pathway may be amenable to therapeutic targeting.",Cancer cell
1,Potentially functional polymorphisms in the LIN28B gene contribute to neuroblastoma susceptibility in Chinese children.,"Neuroblastoma is the most commonly diagnosed solid tumour outside the central nervous system in children. However, genetic factors underlying neuroblastoma remain largely unclear. Previous genome-wide association study indicated that lin-28 homolog B (LIN28B) might play an important role in the development of neuroblastoma and also contributed to its poor overall survival. With the purpose to evaluate the association between LIN28B gene polymorphisms and neuroblastoma susceptibility in Southern Chinese population, we conducted this study with 256 neuroblastoma cases and 531 cancer-free controls. Four potentially functional polymorphisms (rs221634 A>T, rs221635 T>C, rs314276 C>A and rs9404590 T>G) were genotyped using Taqman method. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the associations between the selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and neuroblastoma susceptibility. We also performed genotype-phenotype association analysis to explore the effects of the selected SNPs on LIN28B gene transcripts. Our results indicated that the rs221634 TT genotype was associated with an increased neuroblastoma risk (TT versus Aa/at: adjusted OR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.04-2.17). The association was more pronounced in males, patients with tumour of mediastinum origin, as well as patients in early clinical stages. Moreover, overall analysis and stratified analysis also showed an increased risk of neuroblastoma for carrier of the 2-4 risk genotypes. In summary, these results indicated that the LIN28B rs221634 A>T polymorphism was associated with an increased neuroblastoma risk in Southern Chinese children. These findings need further validation in large studies with different ethnicities involved.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine
2,Common variation at 6q16 within HACE1 and LIN28B influences susceptibility to neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is a cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately 10% of all pediatric oncology deaths. Here, we report a genome-wide association study of 2,817 neuroblastoma cases and 7,473 controls. We identified two new associations at 6q16, the first within HACE1 (rs4336470; combined P=2.7×10(-11); odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18-1.35) and the second within LIN28B (rs17065417; combined P=1.2×10(-8); odds ratio 1.38, 95% CI 1.23-1.54). Expression of LIN28B and let-7 miRNA correlated with rs17065417 genotype in neuroblastoma cell lines, and we observed significant growth inhibition upon depletion of LIN28B, specifically in neuroblastoma cells that were homozygous for the risk allele. Low HACE1 and high LIN28B expression in diagnostic primary neuroblastomas were associated with worse overall survival (P=0.008 and 0.014, respectively). Taken together, these data show that common variants in HACE1 and LIN28B influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and indicate that both genes likely have a role in disease progression.",Nature genetics
3,LIN28B induces neuroblastoma and enhances MYCN levels via let-7 suppression.,"LIN28B regulates developmental processes by modulating microRNAs (miRNAs) of the let-7 family. A role for LIN28B in cancer has been proposed but has not been established in vivo. Here, we report that LIN28B showed genomic aberrations and extensive overexpression in high-risk neuroblastoma compared to several other tumor entities and normal tissues. High LIN28B expression was an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in neuroblastoma. LIN28B signaled through repression of the let-7 miRNAs and consequently resulted in elevated MYCN protein expression in neuroblastoma cells. LIN28B-let-7-MYCN signaling blocked differentiation of normal neuroblasts and neuroblastoma cells. These findings were fully recapitulated in a mouse model in which LIN28B expression in the sympathetic adrenergic lineage induced development of neuroblastomas marked by low let-7 miRNA levels and high MYCN protein expression. Interference with this pathway might offer therapeutic perspectives.",Nature genetics
4,Genetic Variations of GWAS-Identified Genes and Neuroblastoma Susceptibility: a Replication Study in Southern Chinese Children.,"Neuroblastoma is one of the most commonly diagnosed solid cancers for children, and genetic factors may play a critical role in neuroblastoma development. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified nine genes associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility in Caucasians. To determine whether genetic variations in these genes are also associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility in Southern Chinese children, we genotyped 25 polymorphisms within these genes by the TaqMan method in 256 cases and 531 controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of the associations. We performed a meta-analysis to further evaluate the associations. Furthermore, we calculated the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) to assess which gene/genes may better predict neuroblastoma risk. We confirmed that CASC15 rs6939340 A>G, rs4712653 T>C, rs9295536 C>A, LIN28B rs221634 A>T, and LMO1 rs110419 A>G were associated with significantly altered neuroblastoma susceptibility. We also confirmed that rs6939340 A>G (G versus A: OR=1.30, 95% CI=1.13-1.50) and rs110419 G>A (A versus G: OR=1.37, 95% CI=1.19-1.58) were associated with increased neuroblastoma risk for all subjects. We also found that the combination of polymorphisms in CASC15, LIN28B, and LMO1 may be used to predict neuroblastoma risk (AUC=0.63, 95% CI=0.59-0.67). Overall, we verified five GWAS-identified polymorphisms that were associated with neuroblastoma susceptibility alteration for Southern Chinese population; however, these results need further validation in studies with larger sample sizes.",Translational oncology
5,Neuroblastoma models for insights into tumorigenesis and new therapies.,"Introduction: Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children. It occurs in the adrenosympathetic lineage, which is derived from the neural crest. MYCN amplification is found in about 20% of cases and is the most powerful prognostic factor. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) mutation is also found in 7% of sporadic neuroblastomas and 50% of familial neuroblastomas. Although several mutations other than ALK are also found, about 70% of neuroblastomas show no mutations. Another important feature of neuroblastoma is that it sometimes spontaneously regresses. These features collectively suggest that neuroblastoma is caused by aberrations in the normal development processes of the neural crest. Areas covered: This review highlights a number of models of neuroblastoma including genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs). The main GEMMs described here are: tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-MYCN, TH-MYCN/Trp53(+/-), TH-MYCN/TH-Cre/Casp8(flox/flox), TH-MYCN/TH-ALK(F1174L) and DBH-iCre/CAG-LSL-Lin28b. Expert opinion: The current mouse models available are very useful for investigating the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and for developing therapeutics. However, many aspects have not yet been addressed. These include immediate early events after tumor initiation, epigenetic changes, spontaneous regression and metastasis. On the other hand, the current models do not perfectly recapitulate features of human neuroblastoma. Therefore, humanized mice and new GEMMs should be also considered for future research.",Expert opinion on drug discovery
6,Neuroblastoma: A Tough Nut to Crack.,"Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumor arising from neural crest-derived progenitor cells, is the most common solid tumor in childhood, with more than 700 cases diagnosed per year in the United States. In the past several decades, significant advances have been made in the treatment of neuroblastoma. Treatment advances reflect improved understanding of the biology of neuroblastoma. Although amplification of MYCN was discovered in the early 1980s, our understanding of neuroblastoma oncogenesis has advanced in the last decade as a result of high-throughput genomic analysis, exome and whole-genome sequencing, genome-wide association studies, and synthetic lethal drug screens. Our refined understanding of neuroblastoma biology and genetics is reflected in improved prognostic stratification and appropriate tailoring of therapy in recent clinical trials. Moreover, for high-risk neuroblastoma, a disease that was uniformly fatal 3 decades ago, recent clinical trials incorporating autologous hematopoietic transplant and immunotherapy utilizing anti-GD2 antibody plus cytokines have shown improved event-free and overall survival. These advances have resulted in a growing population of long-term survivors of neuroblastoma. Examination of the late effects and second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in both older generations of survivors and more recently treated survivors will inform both design of future trials and surveillance guidelines for long-term follow-up. As a consequence of advances in understanding of the biology of neuroblastoma, successful clinical trials, and refined understanding of the late effects and SMNs of survivors, the promise of precision medicine is becoming a reality for patients with neuroblastoma.",American Society of Clinical Oncology educational book.

7,Collaborative ISL1/GATA3 interaction in controlling neuroblastoma oncogenic pathways overlapping with but distinct from MYCN.,"Background: Transcription factor ISL1 plays a critical role in sympathetic neurogenesis. Expression of ISL1 has been associated with neuroblastoma, a pediatric tumor derived from sympatho-adrenal progenitors, however the role of ISL1 in neuroblastoma remains unexplored. Method: Here, we knocked down ISL1 (KD) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and performed RNA-seq and ISL1 ChIP-seq analyses. Results: Analyses of these data revealed that ISL1 acts upstream of multiple oncogenic genes and pathways essential for neuroblastoma proliferation and differentiation, including LMO1 and LIN28B. ISL1 promotes expression of a number of cell cycle associated genes, but represses differentiation associated genes including RA receptors and the downstream target genes EPAS1 and CDKN1A. Consequently, Knockdown of ISL1 inhibits neuroblastoma cell proliferation and migration in vitro and impedes tumor growth in vivo, and enhances neuronal differentiation by RA treatment. Furthermore, genome-wide mapping revealed a substantial co-occupancy of binding regions by ISL1 and GATA3, and ISL1 physically interacts with GATA3, and together they synergistically regulate the aforementioned oncogenic pathways. In addition, analyses of the roles of ISL1 and MYCN in MYCN-amplified and MYCN non-amplified neuroblastoma cells revealed an epistatic relationship between ISL1 and MYCN. ISL1 and MYCN function in parallel to regulate common yet distinct oncogenic pathways in neuroblastoma. Conclusion: Our study has demonstrated that ISL1 plays an essential role in neuroblastoma regulatory networks and may serve as a potential therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.",Theranostics
8,"N-Myc regulates expression of pluripotency genes in neuroblastoma including lif, klf2, klf4, and lin28b.","myc genes are best known for causing tumors when overexpressed, but recent studies suggest endogenous myc regulates pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells. For example, N-myc is associated with a number of tumors including neuroblastoma, but also plays a central role in the function of normal neural stem and precursor cells (NSC). Both c- and N-myc also enhance the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and are linked to neural tumor stem cells. The mechanisms by which myc regulates normal and neoplastic stem-related functions remain largely open questions. Here from a global, unbiased search for N-Myc bound genes using ChIP-chip assays in neuroblastoma, we found lif as a putative N-Myc bound gene with a number of strong N-Myc binding peaks in the promoter region enriched for E-boxes. Amongst putative N-Myc target genes in expression microarray studies in neuroblastoma we also found lif and three additional important embryonic stem cell (ESC)-related factors that are linked to production of iPSC: klf2, klf4, and lin28b. To examine the regulation of these genes by N-Myc, we measured their expression using neuroblastoma cells that contain a Tet-regulatable N-myc transgene (TET21N) as well as NSC with a nestin-cre driven N-myc knockout. N-myc levels closely correlated with the expression of all of these genes in neuroblastoma and all but lif in NSC. Direct ChIP assays also indicate that N-Myc directly binds the lif promoter. N-Myc regulates trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3 in the promoter of lif and possibly in the promoters of several other stem-related genes. Together these findings indicate that N-Myc regulates overlapping stem-related gene expression programs in neuroblastoma and NSC, supporting a novel model by which amplification of the N-myc gene may drive formation of neuroblastoma. They also suggest mechanisms by which Myc proteins more generally contribute to maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of ESC as well as to iPSC formation.",PloS one
9,Combined Replenishment of miR-34a and let-7b by Targeted Nanoparticles Inhibits Tumor Growth in Neuroblastoma Preclinical Models.,"Neuroblastoma (NB) tumor substantially contributes to childhood cancer mortality. The design of novel drugs targeted to specific molecular alterations becomes mandatory, especially for high-risk patients burdened by chemoresistant relapse. The dysregulated expression of MYCN, ALK, and LIN28B and the diminished levels of miR-34a and let-7b are oncogenic in NB. Due to the ability of miRNA-mimics to recover the tumor suppression functions of miRNAs underexpressed into cancer cells, safe and efficient nanocarriers selectively targeted to NB cells and tested in clinically relevant mouse models are developed. The technology exploits the nucleic acids negative charges to build coated-cationic liposomes, then functionalized with antibodies against GD2 receptor. The replenishment of miR-34a and let-7b by NB-targeted nanoparticles, individually and more powerfully in combination, significantly reduces cell division, proliferation, neoangiogenesis, tumor growth and burden, and induces apoptosis in orthotopic xenografts and improves mice survival in pseudometastatic models. These functional effects highlight a cooperative down-modulation of MYCN and its down-stream targets, ALK and LIN28B, exerted by miR-34a and let-7b that reactivate regulatory networks leading to a favorable therapeutic response. These findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic efficacy of miR-34a and let-7b combined replacement and support its clinical application as adjuvant therapy for high-risk NB patients.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)"

0,Shallow Whole Genome Sequencing on Circulating Cell-Free DNA Allows Reliable Noninvasive Copy-Number Profiling in Neuroblastoma Patients.,"Purpose: Neuroblastoma (NB) is a heterogeneous disease characterized by distinct clinical features and by the presence of typical copy-number alterations (CNAs). Given the strong association of these CNA profiles with prognosis, analysis of the CNA profile at diagnosis is mandatory. Therefore, we tested whether the analysis of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) present in plasma samples of patients with NB could offer a valuable alternative to primary tumor DNA for CNA profiling.Experimental Design: In 37 patients with NB, cfDNA analysis using shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) was compared with arrayCGH analysis of primary tumor tissue.Results: Comparison of CNA profiles on cfDNA showed highly concordant patterns, particularly in high-stage patients. Numerical chromosome imbalances as well as large and focal structural aberrations including MYCN and LIN28B amplification and ATRX deletion could be readily detected with sWGS using a low input of cfDNA.Conclusions: In conclusion, sWGS analysis on cfDNA offers a cost-effective, noninvasive, rapid, robust and sensitive alternative for tumor DNA copy-number profiling in most patients with NB.

1,Identification of RNA-Binding Proteins as Targetable Putative Oncogenes in Neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma is a common childhood cancer with almost a third of those affected still dying, thus new therapeutic strategies need to be explored. Current experimental therapies focus mostly on inhibiting oncogenic transcription factor signalling. Although LIN28B, DICER and other RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have reported roles in neuroblastoma development and patient outcome, the role of RBPs in neuroblastoma is relatively unstudied. In order to elucidate novel RBPs involved in MYCN-amplified and other high-risk neuroblastoma subtypes, we performed differential mRNA expression analysis of RBPs in a large primary tumour cohort (n = 498). Additionally, we found via Kaplan-Meier scanning analysis that 685 of the 1483 tested RBPs have prognostic value in neuroblastoma. For the top putative oncogenic candidates, we analysed their expression in neuroblastoma cell lines, as well as summarised their characteristics and existence of chemical inhibitors. Moreover, to help explain their association with neuroblastoma subtypes, we reviewed candidate RBPs' potential as biomarkers, and their mechanistic roles in neuronal and cancer contexts. We found several highly significant RBPs including RPL22L1, RNASEH2A, PTRH2, MRPL11 and AFF2, which remain uncharacterised in neuroblastoma. Although not all RBPs appear suitable for drug design, or carry prognostic significance, we show that several RBPs have strong rationale for inhibition and mechanistic studies, representing an alternative, but nonetheless promising therapeutic strategy in neuroblastoma treatment.",International journal of molecular sciences
2,Common genetic variants in NEFL influence gene expression and neuroblastoma risk.,"The genetic etiology of sporadic neuroblastoma is still largely obscure. In a genome-wide association study, we identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with neuroblastoma at the CASC15, BARD1, LMO1, DUSP12, HSD17B12, HACE1, and LIN28B gene loci, but these explain only a small fraction of neuroblastoma heritability. Other neuroblastoma susceptibility genes are likely hidden among signals discarded by the multiple testing corrections. In this study, we evaluated eight additional genes selected as candidates for further study based on proven involvement in neuroblastoma differentiation. SNPs at these candidate genes were tested for association with disease susceptibility in 2,101 cases and 4,202 controls, with the associations found replicated in an independent cohort of 459 cases and 809 controls. Replicated associations were further studied for cis-effect using gene expression, transient overexpression, silencing, and cellular differentiation assays. The neurofilament gene NEFL harbored three SNPs associated with neuroblastoma (rs11994014: Pcombined = 0.0050; OR, 0.88; rs2979704: Pcombined = 0.0072; OR, 0.87; rs1059111: Pcombined = 0.0049; OR, 0.86). The protective allele of rs1059111 correlated with increased NEFL expression. Biologic investigations showed that ectopic overexpression of NEFL inhibited cell growth specifically in neuroblastoma cells carrying the protective allele. NEFL overexpression also enhanced differentiation and impaired the proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of cells with protective allele and basal NEFL expression, while impairing invasiveness and proliferation of cells homozygous for the risk genotype. Clinically, high levels of NEFL expression in primary neuroblastoma specimens were associated with better overall survival (P = 0.03; HR, 0.68). Our results show that common variants of NEFL influence neuroblastoma susceptibility and they establish that NEFL expression influences disease initiation and progression.",Cancer research
3,Recent insights into the biology of neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma (NB) is an embryonal tumor of the sympathetic nervous system which accounts for 8-10% of pediatric cancers. It is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical behaviors from spontaneous regression to fatal outcome despite aggressive therapies. Considerable progress has been made recently in the germline and somatic genetic characterization of patients and tumors. Indeed, predisposition genes that account for a significant proportion of familial and syndromic cases have been identified and genome-wide association studies have retrieved a number of susceptibility loci. In addition, genome-wide sequencing, copy-number and expression studies have been conducted on tumors and have detected important gene modifications, profiles and signatures that have strong implications for the therapeutic stratification of patients. The identification of major players in NB oncogenesis, including MYCN, ALK, PHOX2B and LIN28B, has enabled the development of new animal models. Our review focuses on these recent advances, on the insights they provide on the mechanisms involved in NB development and their applications for the clinical management of patients.",International journal of cancer
4,The Bromodomain Inhibitor JQ1 and the Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Panobinostat Synergistically Reduce N-Myc Expression and Induce Anticancer Effects.,"Purpose: Patients with neuroblastoma associated with MYCN oncogene amplification experience a very poor prognosis. BET bromodomain inhibitors are among the most promising novel anticancer agents as they block BRD3 and BRD4 from activating oncogene transcription. However, treatment with BET bromodomain inhibitors alone does not result in cancer remission in many murine models. Experimental design: MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells were treated with vehicle control, the BET bromodomain inhibitor JQ1, the histone deacetylase inhibitor panobinostat, or the combination of JQ1 and panobinostat. Genes modulated by JQ1, panobinostat, or the combination therapy were identified by Affymetrix microarray, and cell proliferation and apoptosis were examined by Alamar blue assays and flow cytometry analysis. Modulation of LIN28B promoter activity by BRD3 and BRD4 was examined by chromatin immunoprecipitation and luciferase assays. In addition, neuroblastoma-bearing mice were treated with vehicle control, JQ1, and/or panobinostat. Results: LIN28B was one of the top genes synergistically reduced by JQ1 and panobinostat. BRD3 and BRD4 directly bound to the LIN28B gene promoter and activated LIN28B gene transcription, and knocking down LIN28B reduced the expression of N-Myc protein, but not N-Myc mRNA. JQ1 and panobinostat synergistically reduced LIN28B gene and N-Myc protein expression, and synergistically induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells, but not normal nonmalignant cells in vitro In neuroblastoma-bearing mice, JQ1 and panobinostat synergistically and considerably reduced N-Myc protein expression in tumor tissues and blocked tumor progression. Conclusions: Our findings have identified a novel strategy to reduce the N-Myc oncoprotein expression and a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of aggressive neuroblastoma.

5,Multiple mechanisms disrupt the let-7 microRNA family in neuroblastoma.,"Poor prognosis in neuroblastoma is associated with genetic amplification of MYCN. MYCN is itself a target of let-7, a tumour suppressor family of microRNAs implicated in numerous cancers. LIN28B, an inhibitor of let-7 biogenesis, is overexpressed in neuroblastoma and has been reported to regulate MYCN. Here we show, however, that LIN28B is dispensable in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell lines, despite de-repression of let-7. We further demonstrate that MYCN messenger RNA levels in amplified disease are exceptionally high and sufficient to sponge let-7, which reconciles the dispensability of LIN28B. We found that genetic loss of let-7 is common in neuroblastoma, inversely associated with MYCN amplification, and independently associated with poor outcomes, providing a rationale for chromosomal loss patterns in neuroblastoma. We propose that let-7 disruption by LIN28B, MYCN sponging, or genetic loss is a unifying mechanism of neuroblastoma development with broad implications for cancer pathogenesis.",Nature
6,Meta-mining of copy number profiles of high-risk neuroblastoma tumors.,"Neuroblastoma, a pediatric tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, is predominantly driven by copy number aberrations, which predict survival outcome in global neuroblastoma cohorts and in low-risk cases. For high-risk patients there is still a need for better prognostic biomarkers. Via an international collaboration, we collected copy number profiles of 556 high-risk neuroblastomas generated on different array platforms. This manuscript describes the composition of the dataset, the methods used to process the data, including segmentation and aberration calling, and data validation. t-SNE analysis shows that samples cluster according to MYCN status, and shows a difference between array platforms. 97.3% of samples are characterized by the presence of segmental aberrations, in regions frequently affected in neuroblastoma. Focal aberrations affect genes known to be involved in neuroblastoma, such as ALK and LIN28B. To conclude, we compiled a unique large copy number dataset of high-risk neuroblastoma tumors, available via R2 and a Shiny web application. The availability of patient survival data allows to further investigate the prognostic value of copy number aberrations.",Scientific data
7,Targeting ornithine decarboxylase reverses the LIN28/Let-7 axis and inhibits glycolytic metabolism in neuroblastoma.,"LIN28 has emerged as an oncogenic driver in a number of cancers, including neuroblastoma (NB). Overexpression of LIN28 correlates with poor outcome in NB, therefore drugs that impact the LIN28/Let-7 pathway could be beneficial in treating NB patients. The LIN28/Let-7 pathway affects many cellular processes including the regulation of cancer stem cells and glycolytic metabolism. Polyamines, regulated by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) modulate eIF-5A which is a direct regulator of the LIN28/Let-7 axis. We propose that therapy inhibiting ODC will restore balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis, suppress glycolytic metabolism, and decrease MYCN protein expression in NB. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is an inhibitor of ODC in clinical trials for children with NB. In vitro experiments using NB cell lines, BE(2)-C, SMS-KCNR, and CHLA90 show that DFMO treatment reduced LIN28B and MYCN protein levels and increased Let-7 miRNA and decreased neurosphere formation. Glycolytic metabolic activity decreased with DFMO treatment in vivo. Additionally, sensitivity to DFMO treatment correlated with LIN28B overexpression (BE(2)-C>SMS-KCNR>CHLA90). This is the first study to demonstrate that DFMO treatment restores balance to the LIN28/Let-7 axis and inhibits glycolytic metabolism and neurosphere formation in NB and that PET scans may be a meaningful imaging tool to evaluate the therapeutic effects of DFMO treatment.",Oncotarget
8,Vitamin K3 derivative induces apoptotic cell death in neuroblastoma via downregulation of MYCN expression.,"Neuroblastoma is a pediatric malignant tumor arising from the sympathetic nervous system. The patients with high-risk neuroblastomas frequently exhibit amplification and high expression of the MYCN gene, resulting in worse clinical outcomes. Vitamin K3 (VK3) is a synthetic VK-like compound that has been known to have antitumor activity against various types of cancers. In the present study, we have asked whether VK3 and its derivative, VK3-OH, could have the antitumor activity against neuroblastoma-derived cells. Based on our results, VK3-OH strongly inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death compared to VK3. Treatment of MYCN-driven neuroblastoma cells with VK3-OH potentiated tumor suppressor p53 accompanied by downregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Mcl-1. Interestingly, VK3-OH also suppressed the MYCN at mRNA and protein levels. Furthermore, we found downregulation of LIN28B following VK3-OH treatment in MYCN-amplified and overexpressed neuroblastoma cells. Collectively, our current findings strongly suggest that VK3-OH provides a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with MYCN-driven neuroblastomas.",Biochemistry and biophysics reports
9,Replication of GWAS-identified neuroblastoma risk loci strengthens the role of BARD1 and affirms the cumulative effect of genetic variations on disease susceptibility.,"Several neuroblastoma (NB) susceptibility loci have been identified within LINC00340, BARD1, LMO1, DUSP12, HSD17B12, DDX4, IL31RA, HACE1 and LIN28B by genome-wide association (GWA) studies including European American individuals. To validate and comprehensively evaluate the impact of the identified NB variants on disease risk and phenotype, we analyzed 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an Italian population (370 cases and 809 controls). We assessed their regulatory activity on gene expression in lymphoblastoid (LCLs) and NB cell lines. We evaluated the cumulative effect of the independent loci on NB risk and high-risk phenotype development in Italian and European American (1627 cases and 2575 controls) populations. All NB susceptibility genes replicated in the Italian dataset except for DDX4 and IL31RA, and the most significant SNP was rs6435862 in BARD1 (P = 8.4 × 10(-15)). BARD1 showed an additional and independent SNP association (rs7585356). This variant influenced BARD1 mRNA expression in LCLs and NB cell lines. No evidence of epistasis among the NB-associated variants was detected, whereas a cumulative effect of risk variants on NB risk (European Americans: P (trend) = 6.9 × 10(-30), Italians: P (trend) = 8.55 × 10(13)) and development of high-risk phenotype (European Americans: P (trend) = 6.9 × 10(-13), Italians: P (trend) = 2.2 × 10(-1)) was observed in a dose-dependent manner. These results provide further evidence that the risk loci identified in GWA studies contribute to NB susceptibility in distinct populations and strengthen the role of BARD1 as major genetic contributor to NB risk. This study shows that even in the absence of interaction the combination of several low-penetrance alleles has potential to distinguish subgroups of patients at different risks of developing NB.",Carcinogenesis

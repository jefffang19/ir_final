0,Differentiation of Human Embryonic Stem Cells to Sympathetic Neurons: A Potential Model for Understanding Neuroblastoma Pathogenesis.,"Background and aims: Previous studies modelling human neural crest differentiation from stem cells have resulted in a low yield of sympathetic neurons. Our aim was to optimise a method for the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to sympathetic neuron-like cells (SN) to model normal human SNS development. Results: Using stromal-derived inducing activity (SDIA) of PA6 cells plus BMP4 and B27 supplements, the H9 hESC line was differentiated to neural crest stem-like cells and SN-like cells. After 7 days of PA6 cell coculture, mRNA expression of SNAIL and SOX-9 neural crest specifier genes and the neural marker peripherin (PRPH) increased. Expression of the pluripotency marker OCT 4 decreased, whereas TP53 and LIN28B expression remained high at levels similar to SHSY5Y and IMR32 neuroblastoma cell lines. A 5-fold increase in the expression of the catecholaminergic marker tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and the noradrenergic marker dopamine betahydroxylase (DBH) was observed by day 7 of differentiation. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting for the neural crest marker p75, enriched for cells expressing p75, DBH, TH, and PRPH, was more specific than p75 neural crest stem cell (NCSC) microbeads. On day 28 post p75 sorting, dual immunofluorescence identified sympathetic neurons by PRPH and TH copositivity cells in 20% of the cell population. Noradrenergic sympathetic neurons, identified by copositivity for both PHOX2B and DBH, were present in 9.4% Â± 5.5% of cells. Conclusions: We have optimised a method for noradrenergic SNS development using the H9 hESC line to improve our understanding of normal human SNS development and, in a future work, the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma.",Stem cells international
1,Insights on ornithine decarboxylase silencing as a potential strategy for targeting retinoblastoma.,"Ornithine Decarboxylase (ODC) is a key enzyme involved in polyamine synthesis and is reported to be up regulated in several cancers. However, the effect of ODC gene silencing in retinoblastoma is to be understood for utilization in therapeutic applications. Hence, in this study, a novel siRNA (small interference RNA) targeting ODC was designed and validated in Human Y79 retinoblastoma cells for its effects on intracellular polyamine levels, Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 & 9 activity and Cell cycle. The designed siRNA showed efficient silencing of ODC mRNA expression and protein levels in Y79 cells. It also showed significant reduction of intracellular polyamine levels and altered levels of oncogenic LIN28b expression. By this study, a regulatory loop is proposed, wherein, ODC silencing in Y79 cells to result in decreased polyamine levels, thereby, leading to altered protein levels of Lin28b, MMP-2 and MMP-9, which falls in line with earlier studies in neuroblastoma. Thus, by this study, we propose ODC silencing as a prospective strategy for targeting retinoblastoma.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie

3,In silico discovery of a FOXM1 driven embryonal signaling pathway in therapy resistant neuroblastoma tumors.,"Chemotherapy resistance is responsible for high mortality rates in neuroblastoma. MYCN, an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma, controls pluripotency genes including LIN28B. We hypothesized that enhanced embryonic stem cell (ESC) gene regulatory programs could mark tumors with high pluripotency capacity and subsequently increased risk for therapy failure. An ESC miRNA signature was established based on publicly available data. In addition, an ESC mRNA signature was generated including the 500 protein coding genes with the highest positive expression correlation with the ESC miRNA signature score in 200 neuroblastomas. High ESC m(i)RNA expression signature scores were significantly correlated with poor neuroblastoma patient outcome specifically in the subgroup of MYCN amplified tumors and stage 4 nonamplified tumors. Further data-mining identified FOXM1, as the major predicted driver of this ESC signature, controlling a large set of genes implicated in cell cycle control and DNA damage response. Of further interest, re-analysis of published data showed that MYCN transcriptionally activates FOXM1 in neuroblastoma cells. In conclusion, a novel ESC m(i)RNA signature stratifies neuroblastomas with poor prognosis, enabling the identification of therapy-resistant tumors. The finding that this signature is strongly FOXM1 driven, warrants for drug design targeted at FOXM1 or key components controlling this pathway.",Scientific reports
4,"LIN28A, a sensitive immunohistochemical marker for Embryonal Tumor with Multilayered Rosettes (ETMR), is also positive in a subset of Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT).","Introduction: CNS embryonal tumors comprise a group of highly malignant neoplasms with a wide spectrum of histomorphological entities that includes Medulloblastoma (MB), Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT), Neuroblastoma (NB), Ganglioneuroblastoma (GNB), Embryonal Tumor with Multilayered Rosettes (ETMR), and the embryonal tumor-Not Otherwise Specified (NOS). The entity ETMR includes previously described histopathologic patterns-Embryonal Tumor with Abundant Neuropil and True Rosettes (ETANTR), Ependymoblastoma (EBL), and Medulloepithelioma (MEPL). Based on the histopathological similarities (multilayered rosettes) among ETANTR, EBL, and MEPL, as well as uniform clinical behavior and common molecular genetic characteristics, the WHO revision has created a new entity, ""ETMR."" Immunoreactivity of LIN28A has been identified as a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of this entity. Since there is a paucity of literature regarding immunoreactivity of LIN28A across all embryonal CNS tumors, the present study was undertaken. Materials and methods: During the 5-year study period (2012 to 2016), all the embryonal tumors (MB, AT/RT, other embryonal tumors-ETANTR, MEPL, PNET) that had been earlier diagnosed in the department of neuropathology (cases operated in our institute as well as received as referral) were reviewed. The archived Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and the available immunohistochemistry (IHC) sections were studied. Further, for the other embryonal tumors where the paraffin blocks were available, an extended panel of IHC was performed for confirming the diagnosis of embryonal tumor and only confirmed cases were included in the study. The demographic details of the study cohort were noted. IHC for LIN28A was performed on conventional sections. Results: A total of 396 cases of embryonal tumors including 302 MB, 72 AT/RT, and 22 other embryonal tumors were diagnosed during the study period. Among these, 80 MB, 35 AT/RT, 4 ETANTR, 1 MEPL, 4 NB, 2 GNB, and 1 CNS embryonal tumor-NOS (total-127) were included for the study. LIN28A immunoreactivity was absent in all MB, GNB, NB, and CNS embryonal tumors-NOS whereas all cases of ETMR (4 ETANTR, 1 MEPL) and 8/35 (23%) of AT/RT showed immunopositivity for LIN28A, which was patchy and distinct in most of the cases of ETMR. Conclusion: Our study reiterates that LIN28A is a sensitive IHC marker for the diagnosis of ETMR. We also show that among CNS embryonal tumors, LIN28A is not specific to ETMRs and such immunoreactivity can also be seen in a proportion of AT/RTs.",Child's nervous system : ChNS : official journal of the International Society for Pediatric Neurosurgery
5,Fingering the Correct Culprit: NonRANdom Target Selection for Therapy of Neuroblastoma.,"Despite major advances in the genomics of neuroblastoma, high-risk patients still have considerable morbidity and mortality even with aggressive chemotherapy. In a recent article published in Cancer Cell, Schnepp et al. used an integrated genomic approach to identify the Ras-related nuclear protein (RAN) pathway as being integral in neuroblastoma pathogenesis and provided compelling validation for a role of the LIN28B-RAN-Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) pathway in neuroblastoma. This opens the door to less-toxic and more-effective therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma in the near future.",Trends in cancer

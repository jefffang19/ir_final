0,ELF4 Is a Target of miR-124 and Promotes Neuroblastoma Proliferation and Undifferentiated State.,"13-Cis-retinoic acid (RA) is typically used in postremission maintenance therapy in patients with neuroblastoma. However, side effects and recurrence are often observed. We investigated the use of miRNAs as a strategy to replace RA as promoters of differentiation. miR-124 was identified as the top candidate in a functional screen. Genomic target analysis indicated that repression of a network of transcription factors (TF) could be mediating most of miR-124's effect in driving differentiation. To advance miR-124 mimic use in therapy and better define its mechanism of action, a high-throughput siRNA morphologic screen focusing on its TF targets was conducted and ELF4 was identified as a leading candidate for miR-124 repression. By altering its expression levels, we showed that ELF4 maintains neuroblastoma in an undifferentiated state and promotes proliferation. Moreover, ELF4 transgenic expression was able to counteract the neurogenic effect of miR-124 in neuroblastoma cells. With RNA sequencing, we established the main role of ELF4 to be regulation of cell-cycle progression, specifically through the DREAM complex. Interestingly, several cell-cycle genes activated by ELF4 are repressed by miR-124, suggesting that they might form a TF-miRNA regulatory loop. Finally, we showed that high ELF4 expression is often observed in neuroblastomas and is associated with poor survival. IMPLICATIONS: miR-124 induces neuroblastoma differentiation partially through the downregulation of TF ELF4, which drives neuroblastoma proliferation and its undifferentiated phenotype.",Molecular cancer research : MCR
1,Induction of morphological and functional differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells by miR-124.,"Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour in children, and differentiation is considered its most appropriate therapy. In this work, we studied effects of miR-124 overexpression on differentiation in M17 cell line as a model of neuroblastoma cancer. Influence of miR-124 overexpression on differentiation in M17 cells was studied. M17 cells were infected with lentivirus that contained miR-124 precursor sequence and followed for 2 weeks to differentiate. Ectopic expression of miR-124 in M17 cells changed the shape of spherical undifferentiated cells to cells with extended neurites that formed neuronal networks. Overexpression of MiR-124 respectively increased the expression level of markers of β-Tubulin III, MAP2, SYN, NF-M and Nestin by 16-, 5-, 4-, 2.3- and 2-folds at the messenger RNA level. MiR-124 overexpression also increased the protein levels of β-Tubulin III and MAP2. Moreover, exogenous expression of miR-124 significantly increased the intracellular calcium in differentiated M17 cells. Since miR-124 is naturally expressed in neuronal cells and is downregulated in neuroblastoma cancer cells, differentiation with this type of microRNA can be a novel treatment for neuroblastoma cancer.",Journal of biosciences
2,"A Context-Dependent Role for MiR-124-3p on Cell Phenotype, Viability and Chemosensitivity in Neuroblastoma in vitro.","Neuroblastoma (NB) is a neural crest-derived tumor, which develops before birth or in early childhood, with metastatic dissemination typically preceding diagnosis. Tumors are characterized by a highly heterogeneous combination of cellular phenotypes demonstrating varying degrees of differentiation along different lineage pathways, and possessing distinct super-enhancers and core regulatory circuits, thereby leading to highly varied malignant potential and divergent clinical outcomes. Cytoskeletal reorganization is fundamental to cellular transformations, including the processes of cellular differentiation and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), previously reported by our lab and others to coincide with chemotherapy resistance and enhanced metastatic ability of tumor cells. This study set out to investigate the ability of the neuronal miR-124-3p to reverse the cellular transformation associated with drug resistance development and assess the anti-oncogenic role of this miRNA in in vitro models of drug-resistant adrenergic (ADRN) and mesenchymal (MES) neuroblastoma cell lines. Low expression of miR-124-3p in a cohort of neuroblastomas was significantly associated with poor overall and progression-free patient survival. Over-expression of miR-124-3p in vitro inhibited cell viability through the promotion of cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in addition to sensitizing drug-resistant cells to chemotherapeutics in a panel of morphologically distinct neuroblastoma cell lines. Finally, we describe miR-124-3p direct targeting and repression of key up-regulated cytoskeletal genes including MYH9, ACTN4 and PLEC and the reversal of the resistance-associated EMT and enhanced invasive capacity previously reported in our in vitro model (SK-N-ASCis24).",Frontiers in cell and developmental biology
3,MicroRNA-124 regulates the expression of p62/p38 and promotes autophagy in the inflammatory pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by motor and nonmotor symptoms due to the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. The evidence for a chronic inflammatory reaction mediated by microglial cells in the brain is particularly strong in PD. In our previous study, we have shown that brain-specific microRNA-124 (miR-124) is significantly down-regulated in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD and that it can also inhibit neuroinflammation during the development of PD. However, further investigation is required to understand whether the abnormal expression of miR-124 regulates microglial activation. In this study, we found that the expression of sequestosome 1 (p62) and phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (p-p38) showed a significant increase in LPS-treated immortalized murine microglial cell line BV2 cells in an MPTP-induced mouse model of PD. Knockdown of p62 could suppress the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and p-p38 of microglia. Besides, inhibition of p38 suppressed the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and promoted autophagy in BV2 cells. Moreover, our study is the first to identify a unique role of miR-124 in mediating the microglial inflammatory response by targeting p62 and p38 in PD. In the microglial culture supernatant transfer model, the knockdown of p62 in BV2 cells prevented apoptosis and death of human neuroblastoma cell lines SH-SY5Y (SH-SY5Y) cells following microglia activation. In addition, the exogenous delivery of miR-124 could suppress p62 and p-p38 expression and could also attenuate the activation of microglia in the substantia nigra par compacta of MPTP-treated mice. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-124 could inhibit neuroinflammation during the development of PD by targeting p62, p38, and autophagy, indicating that miR-124 could be a potential therapeutic target for regulating the inflammatory response in PD.-Yao, L., Zhu, Z., Wu, J., Zhang, Y., Zhang, H., Sun, X., Qian, C., Wang, B., Xie, L., Zhang, S., Lu, G.

4,MiR-124 governs glioma growth and angiogenesis and enhances chemosensitivity by targeting R-Ras and N-Ras.,"Background: Glioma is one of the most aggressive and lethal human brain tumors. Accumulating evidence shows that microRNAs play important roles in cancers, including glioma. Previous studies reported that miR-124 levels were downregulated in glioma specimens. Here, we further investigate the potential role of miR-124 in glioma. Methods: The expression levels of miR-124 were detected in glioma specimens by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR. The direct targets of miR-124 were identified by bioinformatics analysis and were further validated by immunoblotting and luciferase reporter assay. The effects of miR-124 on glioma cell proliferation and chemosensitivity to temozolomide were analyzed by Cell-Counting Kit 8 assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by fluorescence activated cell sorting analysis. A xenograft model was used to study the effect of miR-124 on tumor growth and angiogenesis. Results: Expression levels of miR-124 were greatly downregulated in glioma specimens. related Ras viral oncogene homolog (R-Ras) and neuroblastoma Ras viral oncogene homolog (N-Ras) were identified as direct targets of miR-124. MiR-124 inhibited glioma cell growth, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor growth and increased chemosensitivity to temozolomide treatment by negatively regulating the Ras family and its downstream signaling pathways: phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase/Akt and Raf/extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, overexpression of R-Ras rescued the inhibitory effects of miR-124. Meanwhile, overexpression of R-Ras and N-Ras restored miR-124-inhibited vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) transcription activation. In clinical glioma specimens, protein levels of R-Ras and N-Ras were upregulated and inversely correlated with miR-124 expression levels. Conclusions: Taken together, these results revealed that miR-124 levels in tumor tissues are associated with glioma occurrence, angiogenesis, and chemoresistance and that miR-124 may be used as a new diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for glioma in the future.",Neuro-oncology
5,NEAT1 regulates MPP(+)-induced neuronal injury by targeting miR-124 in neuroblastoma cells.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play important roles in Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis. It was indicated that lncRNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) is involved in PD. However, the underlying mechanism of NEAT1 is still not fully explored. Human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y was treated with 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) to mimic PD model in vitro. qRT-PCR was employed to detect the expression of NEAT1, IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α. Starbase database, RNA pull-down assay and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assay were performed to verify the relationship between NEAT1 and miR-124. MTT assay and flow cytometry assay were used to detect cell viability and apoptosis. Elisa was introduced to measure the levels of IL-1β, IL6 and TNF-α in culture media. We found that NEAT1 expression was significantly increased in SH-SY5Y cells after MPP+ treatment in dose- and time- dependent manners. MPP+ induced the expression and secretion of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α, inhibited cell viability and induced apoptosis while these effects could be rescued by NEAT1 silencing. miR-124 was a target of NEAT1. Anti-miR-124 could reverse the effects caused by NEAT1 knockdown in MPP+ treated SH-SY5Y cells. Therefore, we speculated that NEAT1 may regulate MPP+ induced neuronal injury by targeting miR-124 in SH-SY5Y cells.",Neuroscience letters
6,Retinoic acid receptor gamma is targeted by microRNA-124 and inhibits neurite outgrowth.,"During brain development, neurite outgrowth is required for brain development and is regulated by many factors. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) is an important regulator of cell growth and differentiation. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124), a brain-specific microRNA, has been implicated in stimulating neurite growth. In this study, we found that retinoic acid receptor gamma (RARG) expression was decreased, whereas miR-124 expression was increased during neural differentiation in mouse Neuroblastoma (N2a) Cells, P19 embryonal carcinoma (P19) cells, and mouse brain, as detected by immunoblotting or RT-qPCR. And we proved that miR-124 inhibited RARG expression by binding to the 3' UTR of RARG with a luciferase reporter assay. Upregulation of miR-124 (using miR-124 overexpressing plasmid and miR-124 mimic) led to a significant decrease in RARG protein in N2a cells and primary neurons. Therefore, we asked whether and how the miR-124/RARG axis regulates neuronal outgrowth, which is poorly understood. Strikingly, RARG knockdown by shRNA stimulated neurite growth in N2a cells and primary neurons, whereas RARG overexpression (without 3' UTR) inhibited neurite growth in N2a cells, P19 cells, and primary neurons. Furthermore, RARG knockdown could partially eliminate neurite outgrowth defects caused by the inhibitor of miR-124, while RARG overexpression could reverse the neurite outgrowth enhancing effect of the upregulation of miR-124. Collectively, the data reveal that miR-124/RARG axis is critical for neurite outgrowth. RARG emerges as a new target regulated by miR-124 that modulates neurite outgrowth, providing a novel context in which these two molecules function.",Neuropharmacology
7,Silencing of long noncoding RNA XIST attenuated Alzheimer's disease-related BACE1 alteration through miR-124.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder. However, its pathogenetic mechanism is still poorly understood. An increasing number of studies have evidenced the important role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in AD. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect and molecular mechanism of the lncRNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) in AD. Bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) was used to induce an AD model in mice. Hydrogen peroxide (H2 O2 ) was used to induce an AD model in N2a cells. The lncRNA XIST, miR-124, and BACE1 messenger RNA expression levels were detected by a real-time polymerase chain reaction. The BACE1 protein expression level was detected by western blot and immunofluorescence assay. The Aβ1-42 expression level was detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The expression level of lncRNA XIST was significantly upregulated in AD models, both in vivo and in vitro. Silencing of lncRNA XIST negatively regulated miR-124 and positively regulated BACE1 expression in N2a cells, which is attenuated by cotransfection of anti-miR-124 oligodeoxyribonucleotide (AMO-124). Silencing of lncRNA XIST reversed the effect of H2 O2 on miR-124, BACE1, and Aβ1-42 expression in N2a cells, which was reversed by cotransfection of AMO-124. Silencing of lncRNA XIST attenuated AD-related BACE1 alteration through miR-124. LncRNA XIST may be a new potential target for the treatment of AD.",Cell biology international
8,MiR-124-3p attenuates hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein-induced apoptosis via caveolin-1-PI3K/Akt/GSK3beta pathway in N2a/APP695swe cells.,"Hyperphosphorylation of Tau forming neurofibrillary tangles has been considered as a crucial event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). MiR-124-3p belongs to microRNA (miRNA) family and was markedly decreased in AD, however, the functions of miR-124-3p in the pathogenesis of AD remain unknown. We observed that the expression of miR-124-3p was significantly decreased in N2a/APP695swe cells; and transfection of miR-124-3p mimics not only attenuated cell apoptosis and abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau protein without any changes of total Tau protein, but also increased expression levels of Caveolin-1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), phospho-Akt (Akt-Ser473)/Akt, phospho-glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β-Ser9)/GSK-3β in N2a/APP695swe cells. We further found that miR-12-3p directly targeted Caveolin-1; miR-124-3p inhibited abnormal hyperphosphorylation of Tau by regulating Caveolin-1-PI3K/Akt/GSK3β pathway in AD. This study reveals that miR-124-3p may play a neuroprotective role in AD, which may provide new ideas and therapeutic targets for AD.",Oncotarget
9,Role of miR-124 in the regulation of retinoic acid-induced Neuro-2A cell differentiation.,"Retinoic acid can cause many types of cells, including mouse neuroblastoma Neuro-2A cells, to differentiate into neurons. However, it is still unknown whether microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in this neuronal differentiation. To address this issue, real-time polymerase chain reaction assays were used to detect the expression of several differentiation-related miRNAs during the differentiation of retinoic acid-treated Neuro-2A cells. The results revealed that miR-124 and miR-9 were upregulated, while miR-125b was downregulated in retinoic acid-treated Neuro-2A cells. To identify the miRNA that may play a key role, miR-124 expression was regulated by transfection of miRNA mimics or inhibitors. Morphological analysis results showed that inhibition of miR-124 expression reversed the effects of retinoic acid on neurite outgrowth. Moreover, miR-124 overexpression alone caused Neuro-2A cells to differentiate into neurons, and its inhibitor could block this effect. These results suggest that miR-124 plays an important role in retinoic acid-induced differentiation of Neuro-2A cells.",Neural regeneration research

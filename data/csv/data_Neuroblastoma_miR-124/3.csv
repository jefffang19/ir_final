0,Solid tumors of childhood display specific serum microRNA profiles.,"Background: Serum biomarkers for diagnosis and risk stratification of childhood solid tumors would improve the accuracy/timeliness of diagnosis and reduce the need for invasive biopsies. We hypothesized that differential expression and/or release of microRNAs (miRNAs) by such tumors may be detected as altered serum miRNA profiles. Methods: We undertook global quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) miRNA profiling (n = 741) on RNA from 53 serum samples, representing 33 diagnostic cases of common childhood cancers plus 20 controls. Technical confirmation was performed in a subset of 21 cases, plus four independent samples. Results: We incorporated robust quality control steps for RNA extraction, qRT-PCR efficiency and hemolysis quantification. We evaluated multiple methods to normalize global profiling data and identified the 'global mean' approach as optimal. We generated a panel of six miRNAs that were most stable in pediatric serum samples and therefore most suitable for normalization of targeted miRNA qRT-PCR data. Tumor-specific serum miRNA profiles were identified for each tumor type and selected miRNAs underwent confirmatory testing. We identified a panel of miRNAs (miR-124-3p/miR-9-3p/miR-218-5p/miR-490-5p/miR-1538) of potential importance in the clinical management of neuroblastoma, as they were consistently highly overexpressed in MYCN-amplified high-risk cases (MYCN-NB). We also derived candidate miRNA panels for noninvasive differential diagnosis of a liver mass (hepatoblastoma vs. combined MYCN-NB/NB), an abdominal mass (Wilms tumor vs. combined MYCN-NB/NB), and sarcoma subtypes. Conclusions: This study describes a pipeline for robust diagnostic serum miRNA profiling in childhood solid tumors, and has identified candidate miRNA profiles for prospective testing. Impact: We propose a new noninvasive method with the potential to diagnose childhood solid tumors.","Cancer epidemiology, biomarkers & prevention : a publication of the American Association for Cancer Research, cosponsored by the American Society of Preventive Oncology"
1,REST controls self-renewal and tumorigenic competence of human glioblastoma cells.,"The Repressor Element 1 Silencing Transcription factor (REST/NRSF) is a master repressor of neuronal programs in non-neuronal lineages shown to function as a central regulator of developmental programs and stem cell physiology. Aberrant REST function has been associated with a number of pathological conditions. In cancer biology, REST has been shown to play a tumor suppressor activity in epithelial cancers but an oncogenic role in brain childhood malignancies such as neuroblastoma and medulloblastoma. Here we examined REST expression in human glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) specimens and its role in GBM cells carrying self-renewal and tumorigenic competence. We found REST to be expressed in GBM specimens, its presence being particularly enriched in tumor cells in the perivascular compartment. Significantly, REST is highly expressed in self-renewing tumorigenic-competent GBM cells and its knock down strongly reduces their self-renewal in vitro and tumor-initiating capacity in vivo and affects levels of miR-124 and its downstream targets. These results indicate that REST contributes to GBM maintenance by affecting its self-renewing and tumorigenic cellular component and that, hence, a better understanding of these circuitries in these cells might lead to new exploitable therapeutic targets.",PloS one
2,Human Staufen1 associates to miRNAs involved in neuronal cell differentiation and is required for correct dendritic formation.,"Double-stranded RNA-binding proteins are key elements in the intracellular localization of mRNA and its local translation. Staufen is a double-stranded RNA binding protein involved in the localised translation of specific mRNAs during Drosophila early development and neuronal cell fate. The human homologue Staufen1 forms RNA-containing complexes that include proteins involved in translation and motor proteins to allow their movement within the cell, but the mechanism underlying translation repression in these complexes is poorly understood. Here we show that human Staufen1-containing complexes contain essential elements of the gene silencing apparatus, like Ago1-3 proteins, and we describe a set of miRNAs specifically associated to complexes containing human Staufen1. Among these, miR-124 stands out as particularly relevant because it appears enriched in human Staufen1 complexes and is over-expressed upon differentiation of human neuroblastoma cells in vitro. In agreement with these findings, we show that expression of human Staufen1 is essential for proper dendritic arborisation during neuroblastoma cell differentiation, yet it is not necessary for maintenance of the differentiated state, and suggest potential human Staufen1 mRNA targets involved in this process.",PloS one

0,MiR-429 and MiR-143-3p Function as Diagnostic and Prognostic Markers for Osteosarcoma.,"Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is a highly malignant mesenchymal tumor with a low survival rate and a high metastatic rate. Recently, microRNAs were reported to be potential diagnostic and prognostic markers in various cancers, including osteosarcoma. The present study aimed to determine the clinical values of miR-429 and miR-143-3p in OS concerning diagnosis and prognosis. Methods: miR-429 and miR-143-3p expression in serum samples from OS patients and matched healthy controls were measured by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The association with miR-429 or miR-143-3p and clinicopathological features were compared by Student's t-test. The diagnostic and prognostic values of miR-429 and miR-143-3p in OS were verified by ROC analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival assays. Results: MiR-429 expression (0.3234 ± 0.0224) and miR-143-3p expression (0.7463 ± 0.0282) were significantly down-regulated in the serum from OS patients. Moreover, low miR-429 expression was remarkably associated with tumor size (p < 0.001), clinical-stage (p < 0.001), and distant metastasis (p < 0.001); low miR-143-3p expression was remarkably associated with tumor size (p = 0.0020), clinical-stage (p < 0.001), and distant metastasis (p < 0.001). Importantly, the area under the curves (AUC) of miR-429 and miR-143-3p were 0.9222 (95% CI: 0.8714 - 0.9730) and 0.8300 (95% CI: 0.7484 - 0.9116), respectively. The cutoff values were 1.0692 and 0.9913 with the highest specificity and sensitivity. The OS patients with lower miR-429 or miR-143-3p expressions survived shorter than those with higher miR-429 or miR-143-3p expressions (p = 0.0409 and 0.0421). Conclusions: Serum miR-429 and miR-143-3p may function as diagnostic and prognostic markers for OS.",Clinical laboratory
1,"miR-143-3p inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion in osteosarcoma by targeting FOSL2.","Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common type of primary malignant bone tumor and mainly occurs in children and adolescent. Because of its early migration and invasion, OS has a poor prognosis. It has been reported that mircoRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of multiple tumors. In this study, we identified the aberrant-expression of miR-143-3p in osteosarcoma and examined the role of miR-143-3p in OS development. Further, we searched the miR-143-3p target gene and verified its accuracy by luciferase experiments. Finally, we explored the relationship between miR-143-3p and FOS-Like antigen 2 (FOSL2). Our data indicated that miR-143-3p expression was substantially lower in OS tissues and cell-line compared with normal tissues, and was lower in patients with poor prognosis. In addition miR-143-3p inhibited OS cell proliferation and metastasis while promoting apoptosis. We next showed that FOSL2 was directly targeted by miR-143-3p and could reverse the inhibition caused by miR-143-3p. Finally, we found FOSL2 expression in OS cells was significantly higher compared with normal cells and negatively correlated with miR-143-3p. Thus, miR-143-3p directly and negatively targets FOSL2 to affect OS characteristics. This provides a new target for the treatment of OS and deserves further study.",Scientific reports
2,"Mechanism of miR-143-3p inhibiting proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells by targeting MAPK7.","Objective: To investigate the effects of miR-143-3p and MAPK7 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of U2OS human osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Methods: The expression of miR-143-3p and MAPK7 in U2OS cells were detected by qRT-PCR, and the protein level of MAPK7 was measured by western blot assay. The targeting relationship between miR-143-3p and MAPK7 was predicted by TargetScan and verified by dual luciferase reporter assay. MTT and Transwell assays were used to detect cell viability, migrated cells and invaded cells of U2OS cells. Results: Compared with hFOB1.19 cells, the expression of miR-143-3p was down-regulated and MAPK7 was up-regulated in U2OS cells. Cell viability, migration and invasion ability significantly decreased induced by miR-143-3p overexpression or MAPK7 knockdown in U2OS cells. The results of dual luciferase reporter assay indicated that miR-143-3p interacted with MAPK7. Furthermore, overexpression of MAPK7 could reverse the inhibitory effects on cell proliferation, migration and invasion in U2OS cells induced by miR-143-3p mimics. Conclusion: miR-143-3p could inhibit proliferation, migration and invasion of U2OS cells by targeting MAPK7.","Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology"
3,MiR-143 regulates the proliferation and migration of osteosarcoma cells through targeting MAPK7.,"Accumulating documents have been suggested that microRNA-143 (miR-143) function as a tumor suppressor, involved in many biological processes including tumor initiation and progression. However, the biological function and molecular mechanism of miR-143 in Osteosarcoma (OS) still remains to be further investigated. Despite many efforts have been made, the prognosis of OS is still unsatisfied. Thus, exploring the underlying mechanism of OS and finding new treatment targets is essential for improving the survival rate of OS patients. In our study, we determined the level of miR-143 in clinical OS tissues and cells, and explored its function and underlying mechanisms in the tumorigenesis of OS. Our findings revealed that miR-143 expression was significantly downregulated in OS tissues and cell lines. Gain-of-function assays indicated that forced expression of miR-143 in OS cells inhibited cell proliferation and migration/invasion. Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays confirmed that MAPK7 was targets gene of miR-143. The results of the present study indicated that miR-143 could be a potential target for treating OS.",Archives of biochemistry and biophysics
4,"Clinical significance of tumor miR-21, miR-221, miR-143, and miR-106a as biomarkers in patients with osteosarcoma.","Objective: To investigate the expression of miR-21, miR-221, miR-143, and miR-106a in patients' osteosarcoma samples, and to explore the correlation between these microRNAs (miRNAs) and the clinical stage of osteosarcoma. Methods: RNA was extracted from tumor and tumor-adjacent normal bone tissues from 94 patients with osteosarcoma. RNA reverse-transcription was carried out using an miRNA reverse transcription kit. The levels of miR-21, miR-221, miR-143, and miR-106a in osteosarcoma and normal bone tissues were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction using SYBR Premix Ex Taq™II. Results: The expression levels of miR-21, mirR-221, and miR-106a were significantly higher in 90.42%, 84.04%, and 92.55 % of the osteosarcoma samples compared to the adjacent normal tissues (P<0.05), respectively. While the expression of miR-143 was significantly lower compared to the adjacent normal tissues (P <0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of miR-21 and miR-221 were positively correlated with the Enneking clinical stage and the presence of lung metastasis (P <0.05), while the expression levels of miR-143 and miR-106a showed a significant inverse and direct correlation respectively, with the tumor grade. Conclusions: The upregulation of miR-21, miR-221, and miR-106a, as well as the down-regulation of miR-143 were correlated with the pathological stage, tumor grade, and lung metastasis. Therefore, the levels of these miRNAs can serve as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of osteosarcoma, and can be used as potential therapeutic targets.",The International journal of biological markers
5,KIAA1429 promotes osteosarcoma progression by promoting stem cell properties and is regulated by miR-143-3p.,"Background: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy, it has a dismal prognosis and mainly affects the children and adolescents. Previous reports have demonstrated that aberrantly expressed KIAA1429 plays crucial roles in the carcinogenesis of several cancers, but its expression status and functional role in the progression of OS have not previously been investigated.Methods: Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and western blotting were conducted to determine KIAA1429 expression status in OS. The relationship between KIAA1429 expression and OS prognosis was analyzed based on public database and tissue microarray (TMA). Cell proliferation ability was evaluated by CCK8, EdU and colony formation assays, and Transwell and wound healing potential were also assessed in vitro. Xenograft nude mouse model was performed to elucidate the tumor growth in vivo. The main specific miRNA targeting KIAA1429 in OS cells was identified.Results: KIAA1429 expression is markedly overexpressed in OS, and elevated KIAA1429 expression is significantly associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Functional investigations demonstrate that KIAA1429 silencing could attenuate proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of OS in vitro, as well as tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, microRNA-143-3p (miR-143-3p) was identified as the crucial specific mediator of KIAA1429 expression in OS cells. Furthermore, restoring KIAA1429 expression could partially reverse miR-143-3p mediated tumor-inhibition effects. Additionally, we found that knockdown of KIAA1429 or ectopic overexpression of miR-143-3p could repress stemness cell properties and the inhibition could be partly abolished by overexpression of KIAA1429.Conclusions: In summary, this study establishes miR-143-3p/KIAA1429 axis as promising therapeutic target for OS patients.","Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)"
6,Effect of miR-143 on the apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells.,"As one common malignant bone cancer, osteosarcoma is mainly occurred in young people with increasing incidences. Current treatment of osteosarcoma includes surgery and chemo-/radio-therapy. Due to the unclear pathogenesis mechanism, the overall treatment efficacy is still not satisfactory. As anti-apoptotic molecule Bcl-2 has been suggested to be related with osteosarcoma and is regulated by miR-143, we thus investigated the correlation between miR-143 and Bcl-2 in osteosarcoma patients, in an attempt to elucidate the role of miR-143 in cancer occurrence. Real-time fluorescent RT-PCR was used to quantify expression levels of miR-143 and Bcl-2 from a total of 5 osteosarcoma patients, along with protein contents determination by Western blotting. In vitro study was also performed to detect Bcl-2 expression and cell apoptosis via silencing or over-expressing miR-143 in cultured osteosarcoma cells. MiR-143 showed down-regulation in osteosarcoma tissues. Bcl-2, however, had elevated expression in cancer cells when compared to adjacent tissues (P<0.05). In cultured cells, Bcl-2 expression level was also potentiated after knock-down of miR-143, while those cells with miR-143 over-expression had depressed Bcl-2 levels. Those cells transfected with miR-143 mimics had higher percentage of apoptotic cells. MiR-143 can regulate the expression of Bcl-2 gene in osteosarcoma cells, and mediate the apoptotic process, thereby playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma.",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology
7,"PAI-1, a target gene of miR-143, regulates invasion and metastasis by upregulating MMP-13 expression of human osteosarcoma.","Despite recent improvements in the therapy for osteosarcoma, 30-40% of osteosarcoma patients die of this disease, mainly due to its lung metastasis. We have previously reported that intravenous injection of miR-143 significantly suppresses lung metastasis of human osteosarcoma cells (143B) in a mouse model. In this study, we examined the biological role and mechanism of miR-143 in the metastasis of human osteosarcoma cells. We identified plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) as a direct target gene of miR-143. To determine the role of PAI-1 in human osteosarcoma cells, siRNA was transfected into 143B cells for knockdown of PAI-1 expression. An in vitro study showed that downregulation of PAI-1 suppressed cell invasion activity, but not proliferation. Moreover, injection of PAI-1 siRNA into a primary lesion in the osteosarcoma mouse model inhibited lung metastasis compared to control siRNA-injected mice, without influencing the proliferative activity of the tumor cells. Subsequent examination using 143B cells revealed that knockdown of PAI-1 expression resulted in downregulation of the expression and secretion of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), which is also a target gene of miR-143 and a proteolytic enzyme that regulates tumor-induced osteolysis. Immunohistochemical analysis using clinical samples showed that higher miR-143 expressing cases showed poor expression of PAI-1 in the primary tumor cells. All such cases belonged to the lung metastasis-negative group. Moreover, the frequency of lung metastasis-positive cases was significantly higher in PAI-1 and MMP-13 double-positive cases than in PAI-1 or MMP-13 single-positive or double-negative cases (P < 0.05). These results indicated that PAI-1, a target gene of miR-143, regulates invasion and lung metastasis via enhancement of MMP-13 expression and secretion in human osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that these molecules could be potential therapeutic target genes for preventing lung metastasis in osteosarcoma patients.",Cancer medicine
8,MicroRNA-143 promotes apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by caspase-3 activation via targeting Bcl-2.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor. In recent years, although a lot of research in the mechanism of osteosarcoma development and metastasis had been done, the molecular mechanisms are still elusive. MicroRNAs (miRs), as small noncoding RNA sequences, are dysregulated in various diseases, including cancer, negatively modulating the target genes expression by posttranscriptional repression. MicroRNA-143 (miR-143) has been reported to be reduced in cancers, including pituitary, colorectal, prostate cancer and cervical. We were aimed to detect the effects of miR-143 on osteosarcoma cell invasion and migration as well as to indicate the potential molecular mechanisms by which miR-143 regulated osteosarcoma. After miR-143 transfection, the cancer cells migration and invasion were examined. And Western blot, RT-PCR, flow cytometry and immunochemistry assays were performed to analyze the role of miR-143 in osteosarcoma progression. The results suggested that miR-143 expressed lessly in osteosarcoma cell lines and could suppress cell migration and invasion in U2-OS and MG-63 cells. To our knowledge, it was the first time to target Bcl-2 directly to explore the underlying mechanism by which miR-143 performed its role to induce apoptosis in tumor cells, thus improving osteosarcoma progression. The present study indicated that miR-143 could inhibit Bcl-2 expression, causing Caspas3 activation, thus inducing apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells. MiR-143 may therefore sreve as a potential biomarker for osteosarcoma, and the regulation of its expression might be a novel therapeutic strategy for osteosarcoma treatment.",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie
9,LncRNA-SARCC sensitizes osteosarcoma to cisplatin through the miR-143-mediated glycolysis inhibition by targeting Hexokinase 2.,"Chemotherapy is one of the primary treatments used against cancer. Cisplatin is a conventional chemotherapy drug used to treat osteosarcoma; however, due to the development of cisplatin resistance, advantageous therapeutic outcomes and prognosis of osteosarcoma remain low. Thus, investigation of the specific targeted therapies to circumvent the anti-chemoresistance of osteosarcoma depends on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance. Tumor cells display an increased utilization of glycolysis rather than oxidative phosphorylation. This phenomenon is called the ""Warburg effect,"" which presents a survival advantage for tumor cells, leading to chemoresistance. To date, the molecular mechanism underlying osteosarcoma cisplatin resistance remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we reported the significant down-regulation of the long noncoding RNA-Suppressing Androgen Receptor in Renal Cell Carcinoma (lncRNA-SARCC) in the cells of osteosarcoma and in the specimens from osteosarcoma patients. Moreover, we observed a negative correlation between the lncRNA-SARCC and cisplatin resistance in the osteosarcoma tissues. Overexpression of the lncRNA-SARCC sensitizes osteosarcoma cells to cisplatin. From microarray analysis, we screened several miRNAs, which are significantly regulated by the lncRNA-SARCC in osteosarcoma cells, and revealed that lncRNA-SARCC promoted microRNA-43 (miR-143) expression in osteosarcoma. Interestingly, miR-143 showed the same expression pattern with the lncRNA-SARCC in osteosarcoma patient specimens. By establishing a cisplatin-resistant cell line from Sarcoma Osteogenic-2 (Saos-2), we found the cisplatin-resistant cells with down-regulated expressions of the lncRNA-SARCC and miR-143, but with a higher glycolysis rate compared to that in parental cells. We identified the glycolysis key enzyme, Hexokinase 2 (HK2), as a direct target for miR-143 in osteosarcoma. Restoration of the HK2 expression in the lncRNA-SARCC-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells reversed cisplatin resistance, suggesting that lncRNA-SARCC-mediated cisplatin sensitivity may be via glycolysis in the miR-143-inhibited osteosarcoma cells. Finally, results from both in vitro and in vivo xenograft models demonstrated that the lncRNA-SARCC was an effective therapeutic agent for overcoming cisplatin resistance in osteosarcoma. Our findings suggest an essential axis of the lncRNA-SARCC-miR-143-HK2 in regulation of osteosarcoma chemosensitivity, presenting the lncRNA-SARCC as a new therapeutic target against cisplatin-resistant osteosarcoma.",Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers

0,TGF-beta1 promotes osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion through the miR-143-versican pathway.,"Background & aims: TGF-β1 is an abundant cytokine present in the tumour microenvironment. It has been shown to trigger versican expression in human osteosarcoma cells, which may account for the metastatic potential of these cells. However, the underlying mechanism of TGF-β1-mediated metastasis remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the roles of versican in TGF-β1-induced osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion. Methods: Sixty paired osteosarcoma tumour tissues and adjacent normal tissues were obtained, and the relationship between Enneking stage and versican expression was tested by ANOVA analysis. Real-time PCR or Western blot was used to detect versican, Smad and miR-143 expression. Osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion was assessed using Boyden chambers. A luciferase reporter assay was employed to validate the miR-143-versican interaction. Results: Both versican isoforms, V0 and V1, were significantly differentially expressed in tumours at different stages. TGF-β1 promoted osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion in vitro by up-regulating versican. Furthermore, TGF-β1 suppressed miR-143 expression through a Smad 2/3-dependent pathway. miR-143 directly targets the versican 3'-UTR, and anti-miR-143 or versican knockdown blocked the effects of TGF-β1. Conclusion: Our results suggest that TGF-β1 up-regulates versican expression by suppressing miR-143, and this pathway is important for osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion.","Cellular physiology and biochemistry : international journal of experimental cellular physiology, biochemistry, and pharmacology"
1,Extracellular vesicles from osteosarcoma cell lines contain miRNAs associated with cell adhesion and apoptosis.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor during childhood and adolescence. Several reports have presented data on serum biomarkers for osteosarcoma, but few reports have analyzed circulating microRNAs (miRNAs). In this study, we used next generation miRNA sequencing to examine miRNAs isolated from microvesicle-depleted extracellular vesicles (EVs) derived from six different human osteosarcoma or osteoblastic cell lines with different degrees of metastatic potential (i.e., SAOS2, MG63, HOS, 143B, U2OS and hFOB1.19). EVs from each cell line contain on average ~300 miRNAs, and ~70 of these miRNAs are present at very high levels (i.e., >1000 reads per million). The most prominent miRNAs are miR-21-5p, miR-143-3p, miR-148a-3p and 181a-5p, which are enriched between 3 and 100 fold and relatively abundant in EVs derived from metastatic SAOS2 cells compared to non-metastatic MG63 cells. Gene ontology analysis of predicted targets reveals that miRNAs present in EVs may regulate the metastatic potential of osteosarcoma cell lines by potentially inhibiting a network of genes (e.g., MAPK1, NRAS, FRS2, PRCKE, BCL2 and QKI) involved in apoptosis and/or cell adhesion. Our data indicate that osteosarcoma cell lines may selectively package miRNAs as molecular cargo of EVs that could function as paracrine agents to modulate the tumor micro-environment.",Gene
2,Long-Noncoding RNA PCAT6 Aggravates Osteosarcoma Tumourigenesis via the MiR-143-3p/ZEB1 Axis.,"Introduction: The long-noncoding RNA PCAT6 plays an important regulatory role in the development of several cancers. However, the expression pattern and underlying mechanisms of PCAT6 in osteosarcoma (OS) are yet unknown. Methods: We used real-time PCR to measure PCAT6 expression in 106 tumor pairs and corresponding non-tumor tissues from OS patients. Statistical analyses were applied to evaluate the prognostic value and associations of PCAT6 expression with clinical parameters. Furthermore, the PCAT6 was silenced with siRNA in OS cells. Moreover, phenotype of PCAT6 silenced OS cells was measured using colony formation, CCK-8, cell migration and invasion assay. Finally, the molecular mechanism of PCAT6/miR-143-3p/ZEB1 axis in OS progression was explored. Results: The expression level of PCAT6 in OS tissues was significantly elevated as compared with that in the adjacent normal bone tissues and that high PCAT6 expression closely correlated with the malignant phenotype and poor survival among patients with OS. Multivariate analyses revealed PCAT6 overexpression as an independent prognostic factor for the poor outcome of patients with OS. Functional assay results demonstrated that the knockdown of PCAT6 expression notably suppressed the proliferation, migration, and invasion of OS cells. An elevated PCAT6 level aggravated the malignant phenotype of OS cells via ZEB1 expression upregulation. Mechanistic studies revealed that PCAT6 could sponge endogenous miR-143-3p and inhibit its activity, resulting in an increase in ZEB1 level. Finally, we demonstrated that the tumour-promoting role of PCAT6 in OS was dependent on the regulation of the miR-143-3p/ZEB1 axis. Conclusion: These findings highlight the potential role of PCAT6, which could serve as a valuable prognostic indicator for patients with OS.",OncoTargets and therapy
3,microRNA-143 is associated with the survival of ALDH1+CD133+ osteosarcoma cells and the chemoresistance of osteosarcoma.,"This study investigated the role of miR-143 in the chemoresistance of osteosarcoma tumor cells and the associated mechanisms. Real-time PCR was used to measure miR-143 levels. Western blot was used to detect protein expression. Cell proliferation was analyzed by MTT assay and Matrigel colony formation assay. Forced miR-143 expression was established by adenoviral vector infection. Cell death was detected by Hoechst33342 staining. Loss of miR-143 expression was observed in osteosarcomas, which correlated with shorter survival of patients with osteosarcomas underlying chemotherapy. In chemoresistant SAOS-2 and U2OS osteosarcomas cells, miR-143 levels were significantly downregulated and accompanied by increases in ATG2B, Bcl-2, and/or LC3-II protein levels, high rate of ALDH1(+)CD133(+) cells, and an increase in Matrigel colony formation ability. H2O2 upregulated p53 and miR-143, but downregulated ATG2B, Bcl-2, and LC3-I expression in U2OS cells (wild-type p53) but not in SAOS-2 (p53-null) cells. Forced miR-143 expression significantly reversed chemoresistance as well as downregulation of ATG2B, LC3-I, and Bcl-2 expression in SAOS-2- and U2OS-resistant cells. Forced miR-143 expression significantly inhibited tumor growth in xenograft SAOS-2-Dox and U2OS-Dox animal models. Loss of miR-143 expression is associated with poor prognosis of patients with osteosarcoma underlying chemotherapy. The chemoresistance of osteosarcoma tumor cells to doxorubicin is associated with the downregulation of miR-143 expression, activation of ALDH1(+)CD133(+) cells, activation of autophagy, and inhibition of cell death. miR-143 may play a crucial role in the chemoresistance of osterosarcoma tumors.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)"
4,Increased circular RNA UBAP2 acts as a sponge of miR-143 to promote osteosarcoma progression.,"Deregulated expression of circular RNA (circRNA) has been determined to be important in carcinogenesis and progression; however, in the most common type of primary malignant bone tumor osteosarcoma, the roles of circRNA in cancer development still remain to be elucidated. Here, we found that circRNA UBAP2 (circUBAP2) expression is significantly increased in human osteosarcoma tissues as compared to those in matched controls. Increased circUBAP2 expression was significantly correlated with human osteosarcoma progression and prognosis. Furthermore, increased circUBAP2 could promote osteosarcoma growth and inhibit apoptosis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circUBAP2 was found to inhibit the expression of microRNA-143 (miR-143), thus enhancing the expression and function of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2, which is a direct target of miR-143. Together, our results suggest the roles of circUBAP2 in osteosarcoma development and implicate its potential in prognosis prediction and cancer therapy.",Oncotarget
5,Long non-coding RNA Taurine upregulated gene 1 promotes osteosarcoma cell metastasis by mediating HIF-1alpha via miR-143-5p.,"Early aggressive metastasis of osteosarcoma (OS) leads to rapid progression and poor prognosis. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could serve as crucial regulators to modulate tumour metastasis. In this study, we reported the critical role of lncRNA TUG1 in determining OS metastasis. TUG1 was significantly upregulated in OS tissues and associated with tumour size, distant metastasis, TNM stage, and overall and recurrence-free survival, which further indicated poor prognosis. Furthermore, CAFs-derived TGF-β could upregulate TUG1 expression, and the crosstalk between CAFs and OS cells induced TUG1 to promote OS cell metastasis. Dysregulated TUG1 expression could act as an miRNA ""sponge"" to competitively protect the HIF-1α mRNA 3'UTR from miR-143-5p. Our study emphasised the effects of TUG1 in OS and demonstrated a novel axis by which TUG1 regulated OS cell metastasis, angiogenesis, and proliferation in vivo and in vitro. Collectively, TUG1 might be a prognostic indicator for OS and could be a therapeutic target for OS.",Cell death & disease
6,MiR-143 inhibits EGFR-signaling-dependent osteosarcoma invasion.,"The molecular regulation of the invasion of osteosarcoma (OS) remains elusive. Here, we reported significant lower level of miR-143 and significant levels of phosphorylated EGFR and MMP9 in the resected OS from the patients, compared to the adjacent normal tissue. Moreover, strong correlation was detected among these three factors. We thus hypothesized existence of a causal link, which prompted us to use two human OS cell lines to study the interaction of miR-143, MMP9, and activation of EGFR signaling. We found that EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation in both lines activated MMP9, and consequently cancer invasiveness. Both an inhibitor for EGFR phosphorylation and an inhibitor for ERK1/2 phosphorylation significantly inhibited the EGF-induced activation of MMP9. Moreover, miR-143 levels did not alter by EGF-induced EGFR phosphorylation, while overexpression of miR-143 antagonized EGF-induced MMP9 activation without affecting EGFR phosphorylation. Taken together, our data suggest that miR-143 inhibits EGFR signaling through its downstream ERK/MAPK signaling cascades to control MMP9 expression in OS. Thus, miR-143, EGFR, and MMP9 are therapeutic targets for inhibiting OS invasion.",Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine
7,"microRNA-143, down-regulated in osteosarcoma, promotes apoptosis and suppresses tumorigenicity by targeting Bcl-2.","Deregulated microRNAs and their roles in tumorigenesis are still largely unknown. Here, we focused on the roles of miR-143 in osteosarcoma, as previous reports have suggested its importance in some other types of cancer. We found that miR-143 was down-regulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and primary tumor samples, and the restoration of miR-143 reduced cell viability, promoted cell apoptosis and suppressed tumorigenicity. Additionally, Bcl-2, an important antiapoptotic molecule, was identified to be a novel direct target of miR-143, and the proapoptotic function of miR-143 is further suggested to be mainly through the targeting of Bcl-2 expression. Collectively, our data identify the important roles of miR-143 in osteosarcoma pathogenesis and indicate its potential application in cancer therapy.",Oncology reports
8,Propofol inhibits proliferation and invasion of osteosarcoma cells by regulation of microRNA-143 expression.,"Propofol is one of the extensively commonly used intravenous anesthetic agents. Previous studies have indicated that propofol has the ability to influence the biological behavior of several human cancer cells. However, the effect of propofol on osteosarcoma and its related molecular mechanisms are still not clear. Here we found that propofol significantly elevated the expression of miR-143, inhibited cell proliferation and invasion, and promoted apoptosis in osteosarcoma cell line MG63. Propofol also efficiently decreased protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13). Moreover, the overexpression of miR-143 decreased MMP-13 protein level. Finally, the neutralization of miR-143 by anti-miR-143 antibody reversed the effect of propofol on cell proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion and upregulated MMP-13 expression in MG63 cells. Taken together, propofol may have antitumor potential in osteosarcoma, which is partly due to the downregulation of MMP-13 expression by miR-143.",Oncology research
9,Exosome-formed synthetic microRNA-143 is transferred to osteosarcoma cells and inhibits their migration.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as potential anticancer agents, but their clinical application is limited by the lack of an effective delivery system to tumors. Exosomes are small vesicles that play important roles in intercellular communication. Here, we show that synthetic miR-143 introduced into cells is released enveloped in exosomes and that the secreted exosome-formed miR-143 is transferred to osteosarcoma cells. The delivery of exosome-formed miR-143 significantly reduced the migration of osteosarcoma cells. The delivery efficiency of exosome-formed miR-143 was less than that achieved with lipofection, but the migratory potential of osteosarcoma cells was similarly inhibited after both strategies. Our results suggest that exosomes can deliver synthetic miR-143 and are a potentially efficient and functional delivery system.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications

0,Preparation and Evaluation of A Novel Liposomal Nano-Formulation in Metastatic Cancer Treatment Studies.,"Objective: Today, in clinical trials, we suffer from the lack of effective methods with minimal side effects to deliver medication. Thus, efforts to identify better conditions for delivery of biomedical drugs seem necessary. The purpose of this study was to design a new liposomal formula for transportation of microRNA in osteosarcoma. Materials and methods: In this experimental study, several liposomal formulations were synthesized. Physical and chemical parameters, including size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, long-term stability of the liposomal-microRNA complex and the amount of miR-143 loading in liposome based nano-vesicles were optimized using different techniques. Similarly, the effect of free and encapsulated microRNA toxicity were investigated and compared in a human bone osteosarcoma cell line, named SaOs-2. Results: In this study, we could produce a novel and optimized formulation of cationic PEGylated liposomal microRNA for gene delivery. The present synthesized microRNA lipoplex system was non-agglomerated. The system remained stable after four months and miR-143 leakage was not observed by performing gel electrophoresis. The microRNA lipoplex could enhance conduction of the loaded miR-143, and it also showed good biocompatibility to the healthy cells. Conclusion: The PEGylated microRNA lipoplex system had a high potential for the systematic migration of miR-143 and it could improve intracellular stability of the released microRNA.",Cell journal
1,"Diallyl trisulfide inhibits proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis of osteosarcoma cells by switching on suppressor microRNAs and inactivating of Notch-1 signaling.","Notch signaling pathway plays critical roles in human cancers, including osteosarcoma, suggesting that the discovery of specific agents targeting Notch would be extremely valuable for osteosarcoma. Our previous studies have shown that diallyl trisulfide (DATS) inhibits proliferation of osteosarcoma cells by triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found that DATS suppressed cell survival, wound-healing capacity, invasion and angiogenesis in osteosarcoma cells. These effects were associated with decreased expression of Notch-1 and its downstream genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as increased expression of a panel of tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-34a, miR-143, miR-145 and miR-200b/c that are typically lost in osteosarcoma. We also found that reexpression of miR-34a and miR-200b by transfection led to reduced expression of Notch-1, resulting in the inhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. These results clearly suggest that DATS inhibited osteosarcoma growth and aggressiveness via a novel mechanism targeting a Notch-miRNA regulatory circuit. Our data provide the first evidence that the downregulation of Notch-1 and reexpression of miRNAs by DATS may be an effective approach for the treatment of osteosarcoma.",Carcinogenesis
2,MicroRNA-143 regulates human osteosarcoma metastasis by regulating matrix metalloprotease-13 expression.,"Pulmonary metastases are the main cause of death in patients with osteosarcoma, however, the molecular mechanisms of metastasis are not well understood. To detect lung metastasis-related microRNA (miRNA) in human osteosarcoma, we compared parental (HOS) and its subclone (143B) human osteosarcoma cell lines showing lung metastasis in a mouse model. miR-143 was the most downregulated miRNA (P < 0.01), and transfection of miR-143 into 143B significantly decreased its invasiveness, but not cell proliferation. Noninvasive optical imaging technologies revealed that intravenous injection of miR-143, but not negative control miRNA, significantly suppressed lung metastasis of 143B (P < 0.01). To search for miR-143 target mRNA in 143B, microarray analyses were performed using an independent RNA pool extracted by two different comprehensive miR-143-target mRNA collecting systems. Western blot analyses revealed that MMP-13 was mostly protein downregulated by miR-143. Immunohistochemistry using clinical samples clearly revealed MMP-13-positive cells in lung metastasis-positive cases, but not in at least three cases showing higher miR-143 expression in the no metastasis group. Taken together, these data indicated that the downregulation of miR-143 correlates with the lung metastasis of human osteosarcoma cells by promoting cellular invasion, probably via MMP-13 upregulation, suggesting that miRNA could be used to develop new molecular targets for osteosarcoma metastasis.",Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy
3,A three-plasma miRNA signature serves as novel biomarkers for osteosarcoma.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common human primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults. Sensitive and non-invasive biomarkers that can facilitate disease detection at early stage are highly desirable to improve survival rate and help to determine optimized treatment for osteosarcoma. The small non-coding RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), have recently been identified as critical regulators for various diseases including cancer and may represent a novel class of cancer biomarkers. In this study, we aimed to detect the potential of circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for osteosarcoma. Levels of six candidate miRNAs (miR-21, miR-199a-3p, miR-143, miR-34, miR-140, and miR-132) that were previously demonstrated to be regulated in osteosarcoma were examined in plasma of 40 osteosarcoma patients and 40 matched healthy controls by quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction assays. The results showed that circulating levels of miR-21 were significantly higher in osteosarcoma patients than controls, while miR-199a-3p and miR-143 were decreased in osteosarcoma patients. We replicated the findings in an independent study of 40 osteosarcoma patients and 40 matched controls and confirmed the results. Receiver operating characteristics curve analysis of the combined populations demonstrated that the three-miRNA signature could discriminate cases from controls with an area under the curve of 0.953 (95 % CI 0.924-0.984). In addition, circulating miR-21 and miR-143 were correlated with both metastasis status and histological subtype of the patients, while miR-199a-3p only correlated with histological subtype. Our data suggest that altered levels of circulating miRNAs might have great potential to serve as novel, non-invasive biomarkers for osteosarcoma.","Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)"
4,Changes in microRNA expression in the MG-63 osteosarcoma cell line compared with osteoblasts.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor, particularly in adolescents and young adults. Early diagnosis remains a significant problem in the clinical treatment of OS as we remain far from a comprehensive understanding of the molecular genetic mechanisms and the biology involved. In addition, microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs), a large family of small non-coding RNAs, may provide a greater understanding of OS as they play a complex role in gene expression regulation in vitro and in vivo. In the current study, the differential expression profiles of miRNAs between OS and osteoblast cell lines were investigated by miRNA microarrays and real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). A total of 268 miRNAs were identified that were significantly dysregulated in OS compared with the osteoblast cell line, including miR-9, miR-99, miR-195, miR-148a and miR-181a, which had been validated as overexpressed, and miR-143, miR-145, miR-335 and miR-539, which were confirmed to be downregulated. This differential expression may aid future OS diagnosis and prognosis prediction and illustration of the potential mechanisms in the oncogenesis, development and metastasis of OS. Bioinformatic research on these differentially expressed miRNAs suggests that they are able to regulate the biological behaviors of OS in a complex and effective manner. Further study on the function of these miRNAs is likely to provide new insights into OS biology and treatment.",Oncology letters

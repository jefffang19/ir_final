0,The DNMT1/miR-34a Axis Is Involved in the Stemness of Human Osteosarcoma Cells and Derived Stem-Like Cells.,"The DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1)/miR-34a axis promoted carcinogenesis of various types of cancers. However, no literature reported its contribution to the stemness of osteosarcoma cancer stem-like cells (OSLCs). We sought to determine whether the DNMT1/miR-34a axis facilitates the stemness of OSLCs. We here revealed the higher DNMT1 activity and expression, lower miR-34a expression with high methylation of its promoter, and stronger stemness of OSLCs, as manifested by elevated sphere and colony formation capacities; CD133, CD44, ABCG2, Bmi1, Sox2, and Oct4 protein amounts in vitro; and carcinogenicity in a nude mouse xenograft model, when compared to the parental U2OS cells. 5-Azacytidine (Aza-dC) repressed DNMT1 activation and upregulated miR-34a expression by promoter demethylation and suppressed the stemness of OSLCs in a dose-dependent manner. DNMT1 knockdown increased miR-34a and reduced the stemness of OSLCs. Transfection with a miR-34a mimic repressed the stemness of OSLCs but did not alter DNMT1 activity and expression. Conversely, DNMT1 overexpression declined miR-34a levels, promoting the stemness of U2OS cells. Transfection with a miR-34a inhibitor enhanced the stemness of U2OS cells, without affecting the DNMT1 activity and expression. Importantly, reexpression of miR-34a could rescue the effects of DNMT1 overexpression on miR-34a inhibition as well as the stemness promotion without affecting the activity and expression of DNMT1. Our results revealed that aberrant activation of DNMT1 caused promoter methylation of miR-34a, leading to miR-34a underexpression, and the role of the DNMT1/miR-34a axis in promoting and sustaining the stemness of OSLCs.",Stem cells international
1,Serum miR-34a is a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for osteosarcoma.,"Background and aims: MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) has been shown to be a potential diagnostic and prognostic marker for several cancers. In addition, miR-34a has been reported to suppress osteosarcoma cell proliferation in vitro. However, the clinical value of miR-34a is still unknown. In the present study, we evaluated serum miR-34a level in osteosarcoma patients to explore its diagnostic and prognostic value for this particular malignancy. Methods: Serum from 120 patients with primary osteosarcoma, and 87 sex- and age-matched healthy individuals were obtained. Serum miR-34a level was measured with by a real-time quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR) and correlation with clinicopathological characteristics was further analyzed using t test. Receiver operating curves (ROC), Kaplan-Meier curves, and log-rank analyses as well as Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate diagnostic and prognostic significance. Results: The serum miR-34a levels was significantly decreased in the serum of osteosarcoma patients compared to healthy controls (P < 0.001). Low miR-34a had significant association with clinical stage (P = 0.006), distant metastasis (P = 0.002), tumor grade (P = 0.038) and response to chemotherapy (P = 0.017). The Kaplan-Meier curve showed that patients with high miR-34a level survived significantly longer than patients with low miR-34a levels (P = 0.036). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that miR-34a level (P = 0.001) was an independent prognostic biomarker for overall survival. To distinguish osteosarcoma patients from healthy controls, ROC/AUC analysis indicated an AUC of 0.83 (sensitivity 0.68; specificity 0.92). Conclusions: Decreased miR-34a might be related to the metastasis of osteosarcoma and might be a novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in osteosarcoma.",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology
2,"miR-34a is downregulated in human osteosarcoma stem-like cells and promotes invasion, tumorigenic ability and self-renewal capacity.","MicroRNA-34 (miR-34), in particular miR-34a, has a negative regulatory effect on osteosarcoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Notably, it is also a post‑transcriptional regulatory factor of (sex determining region Y)‑box 2 (Sox-2), which is required for osteosarcoma cell self‑renewal and tumorigenesis. As a direct regulator of Sox‑2, miR‑34a has been hypothesized to be greatly associated with the regulation of malignancies in osteosarcoma. To investigate the role of miR-34a in the malignancies of osteosarcoma, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the expression level of miR‑34a in osteospheres. The results revealed that the miR‑34a, b and c were suppressed in osteosarcoma stem‑like cells (OSCs) and osteospheres. The introduction of miR‑34a mimics and short hairpin (sh)RNA targeting Sox‑2 mRNA (shSox‑2) in human OSCs markedly reduced their transformation properties in vitro and their capacity to form tumors in soft agar. Furthermore, the epigenetic expression of miR‑34a and shSox‑2 inhibited the expression of the stem cell marker, stem cell antigen‑1 and led to the failure of osteosphere formation, respectively. The data of the present study indicated that the inhibitory role of miR‑34a on tumor growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma may function by reducing the maintenance of osteosphere self‑renewal capacity, elimination of tumorigenic ability and invasion of osteosarcoma in vitro. These findings may provide the basis for a novel therapeutic target of osteosarcomas based on inducing the expression of miR-34a.",Molecular medicine reports
3,miR-34a increases cisplatin sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells in vitro through up-regulation of c-Myc and Bim signal.,"Background and objective: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignancy in bone. Patients who respond poorly to induction chemotherapy are at higher risk of adverse prognosis. The molecular basis for such poor prognosis remains unclear. Recently, increasing evidence has suggested decreased expression of miR-34a is observed in a number of cancer types, including human osteosarcoma, and decreased miR-34a is involved in drug resistance. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of decreased miR-34a on cisplatin chemoresistance in osteosarcoma has not been reported. Methods: Osteosarcoma U2OS cells were transfected with miR-34a mimics for 48 h, then the cells were treated with 3.0 μm cisplatin for 24 h. Using siRNA targeting c-Myc and Bim to examine the relation between miR-34a, c-Myc and Bim expression exposure to cisplatin on cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Results: Treatment of U2OS cells with cisplatin induced cell apoptosis by upregulation of c-Myc -dependent Bim expression; Osteosarcoma U2OS cells transfected with miR-34a mimics (miR-34a/U2OS) induced cell apoptosis and inhibited cell survival, and increased the sensitivity of U2OS cells to cisplatin. U2OS cells transfected with miR-34a mimics upregulated the protein expression of c-Myc and Bim. Targeting c-Myc downregulated the expression of Bim in the miR-34a/U2OS cells. In addition, Targeting Bim reversed the chemeresistance of miR-34a/U2OS cells to cisplatin. Conclusions: Our data indicated that miR-34a enhanced the sensitivity to cisplatin by upregulation of c-Myc and Bim pathway.",Cancer biomarkers : section A of Disease markers
4,Long Non-Coding RNA Metastasis-Associated Lung Adenocarcinoma Transcript 1 (MALAT1) Promotes Proliferation and Metastasis of Osteosarcoma Cells by Targeting c-Met and SOX4 via miR-34a/c-5p and miR-449a/b.,"BACKGROUND Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is a functional long non-coding RNA involved in many biologic processes. The study was aimed to explore the functional roles of MALAT1 in osteosarcoma progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 76 osteosarcoma tissues and paired adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected from surgical resection. MALAT1, miRNAs, and genes mRNA expression levels were detected using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Protein expression level, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed using western blot, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), wound-healing assay, and Matrigel invasion assay respectively. The target relationships among miRNAs, MALAT1, and mRNA were detected via dual-luciferase reporter assay. RESULTS We found that MALAT1 was frequently upregulated in osteosarcoma samples and cell lines and a high level of MALAT1 predicted poor overall survival in osteosarcoma patients. Knockdown of MALAT1 inhibited proliferation, migration, and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Further study showed a positive correlation between MALAT1 and c-Met or SOX4 expression. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that MALAT1, as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA), regulated osteosarcoma proliferation and metastasis through competitively binding to miR-34a/c-5p and miR-449a/b. CONCLUSIONS Taken together, our study illustrates a new regulatory mechanism for MALAT1 and may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of osteosarcoma.",Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research
5,Isovitexin Suppresses Cancer Stemness Property And Induces Apoptosis Of Osteosarcoma Cells By Disruption Of The DNMT1/miR-34a/Bcl-2 Axis.,"Background: Isovitexin (apigenin-6-C-glucoside, ISOV) is a natural flavonoid that exhibits tumor suppressive activity on various types of cancer. However, it is unknown whether the mechanism of its action in osteosarcoma (OS) is associated with epigenetic regulation and whether it involves DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), microRNAs and their targets. Materials and methods: The present study investigated the effects of ISOV on DNMT1 activation and miR-34a and Bcl-2 expression levels in order to explain the mechanism underlying ISOV-mediated repression of proliferation and stemness. In addition, the induction of apoptosis in the spheres derived from OS cells was investigated. Results: The results indicated that ISOV significantly repressed survival, induced apoptosis and decreased the level of CD133, CD44, ABCG2 and ALDH1 mRNA in the spheres derived from U2OS (U2OS-SC) and MG63 cells (MG63-SC). ISOV further reduced the sphere formation rate of U2OS-SC and MG63-SC. It is important to noted that, ISOV inhibited tumor growth and reduced tumor size of U2OS-SC xenografts in nude mice, which was accompanied by decreased CD133 protein levels, elevated apoptotic index, downregulation of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression, reduced DNMT1 activity and expression, increased miR-34a and decreased Bcl-2 levels. We identified that Bcl-2 as a direct functional target of miR-34a. Furthermore, ISOV exhibited a synergistic effect with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, the miR-34a mimic or ABT-263 in order to repress cell survival, induce apoptosis, downregulate CD133, CD44, ABCG2 and ALDH1 mRNA expression levels and reduce sphere formation rates of U2OS-SC and MG63-SC cells. Conclusion: The findings suggested that ISOV-mediated epigenetic regulation involved the DNMT1/miR-34a/Bcl-2 axis and caused the suppression of stemness and induction of apoptosis in the spheres derived from OS cells. The data indicated that ISOV exhibited a novel efficient potential for the treatment of OS.",Cancer management and research
6,Long Noncoding RNA SNHG7 Promotes the Tumor Growth and Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition via Regulation of miR-34a Signals in Osteosarcoma.,"The long noncoding RNA (LncRNA) SNHG7 (small nuclear RNA host gene 7) is a novel LncRNA and functions as an oncogene to promote tumor proliferation and inhibits apoptosis in many cancers. However, the role of SNHG7 in osteosarcoma (OS) remains to be further investigated. In this study, OS tissues and corresponding relative normal tissues (n = 30) were collected to determine the expression of SNHG7 in OS. The results indicated that high SNHG7 level in OS correlated with high Enneking stage, distant metastasis, and short overall survival time of OS patients. Moreover, miRNA-34a (miR-34a) is a classic tumor suppressor. Bioinformatic analysis predicted that SNHG7 harbored miR-34a binding sites, and the authors found that SNHG7 negatively correlated with miR-34a in OS tissues and the SNHG7 inhibition induced the restoration of miR-34a in OS cell lines MG63 and SaOS2, leading to the reactivation of miR-34a-mediated tumor suppression. Knockdown of SNHG7 in tumor cells significantly impaired the cell vitality, migration and invasion or TGF-β-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), induced apoptosis, and G1/S arrest via miR-34a. Mechanistically, the targets of miR-34a could be upregulated by SNHG7, including proliferation-related Notch1, apoptosis-related BCL-2, cell cycle-related CDK6, and EMT-related SMAD4. The oncogene role of SNHG7 in vivo was also confirmed and found that knockdown of SNHG7 delayed the tumor growth with increased miR-34a level and Ki-67 level in OS tissues. These findings demonstrated that the LncRNA SNHG7 is upregulated during the development of OS via inhibition of tumor suppressor miR-34s signals.",Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals
7,"lncRNA C2dat1 Promotes Cell Proliferation, Migration, and Invasion by Targeting miR-34a-5p in Osteosarcoma Cells.","Osteosarcoma is a highly aggressive malignant bone tumor with poor prognosis. Evidence has suggested that lncRNAs are deregulated in multiple cancers. In this study, we investigated the role of the lncRNA C2dat1 on the biological functions of osteosarcoma cells. The expressions of C2dat1, miR-34a-5p, and Sirt1 in human osteosarcoma cells were altered by transfection with their specific vectors/shRNA or mimic/inhibitor. Cell viability, migration, invasion, and apoptosis were assessed posttransfection. The mRNA and protein levels of C2dat1, miR-34a-5p, and Sirt1 were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that C2dat1 suppression reduced cell viability, invasion, and migration, whereas it increased cell apoptosis in OS-732 cells. The expression of miR-34a-5p was downregulated when C2dat1 was overexpressed, whereas it negatively regulated Sirt1 expression. miR-34a-5p overexpression inhibited cell viability, migration, and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells by downregulation of Sirt1. Furthermore, miR-34a-5p overexpression deactivated the p38/ERK/AKT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways by inhibition of Sirt1.",Oncology research
8,MiR-34a and miR-203 Inhibit Survivin Expression to Control Cell Proliferation and Survival in Human Osteosarcoma Cells.,"Elevated expression of survivin is observed in a number of cancer types, including human osteosarcoma. Few studies have demonstrated that survivin expression levels can be considered an independent predictor of survival for human osteosarcoma patients. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of survivin in the process of human osteosarcoma carcinogenesis remain unclear. In the current study, we evaluated the biological effects of survivin knockdown on osteosarcoma cell proliferation, colony formation rate, and sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent cisplatin. We found that two different osteosarcoma cell lines, U2OS and Saos-2, have relatively higher expression levels of survivin, and specific knockdown of survivin resulted in a number of effects, such as inhibition of cell proliferation, decreased colony formation rate, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase, induction of apoptosis, and increased sensitivity to cisplatin. In addition, we identified two microRNAs, miR-34a and miR-203, that are aberrantly expressed in human osteosarcoma cells and specifically target survivin by inhibiting its expression, therefore repressing osteosarcoma cell maintenance and proliferation.",Journal of Cancer
9,Low miR-34a and miR-192 are associated with unfavorable prognosis in patients suffering from osteosarcoma.,"Background: p53 is a well-known tumor suppressor gene involved in malignancy. Many microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been identified as key components of p53 signaling networks, owing to the central role of p53 in many processes, these p53-regulated miRNAs may possess important role in osteosarcoma. Methods: The expression of six p53-related miRNAs (miR-34 family [including miR-34a, 34b and 34c], miR-31, miR-192, and miR-215) in 80 pairs of osteosarcoma and corresponding noncancerous bone tissues were estimated by real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and the associations of miRNAs expression with clinicopathological factors, p53 status, and survival of patients were analyzed. Results: We found that among all six miRNAs, miR-34 family, -192, and -215 had decreased levels, whereas the level of miR-31 was increased (p<0.05) in tumor compared with corresponding noncancerous bone tissues, and miR-192/215 in patients with p53 positive expression was lower than those with negative p53. Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that osteosarcoma patients with low miR-34a (P=0.000) and miR-192 (P=0.022) expression had poorer disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter for patients with low miR-34a and miR-192 expression (P=0.007) and the combination of low miR-192 with p53 positive expression (P=0.000). Furthermore, the multivariate analysis identified that low miR-34a expression, the combination of low miR-34a and miR-192 expression levels and the combination of low miR-192 with p53 positive were independent biomarkers of shorter DFS. Conclusions: Together, these results suggest that p53-associated miR-34a and miR-192 expression could be novel prognosis biomarkers for surgically treated osteosarcoma.",American journal of translational research

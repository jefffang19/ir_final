0,Combination therapy with bioengineered miR-34a prodrug and doxorubicin synergistically suppresses osteosarcoma growth.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common form of primary malignant bone tumor and prevalent among children and young adults. Recently we have established a novel approach to bioengineering large quantity of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) prodrug for miRNA replacement therapy. This study is to evaluate combination treatment with miR-34a prodrug and doxorubicin, which may synergistically suppress human OS cell growth via RNA interference and DNA intercalation. Synergistic effects were indeed obvious between miR-34a prodrug and doxorubicin for the suppression of OS cell proliferation, as defined by Chou-Talalay method. The strongest antiproliferative synergism was achieved when both agents were administered simultaneously to the cells at early stage, which was associated with much greater degrees of late apoptosis, necrosis, and G2 cell cycle arrest. Alteration of OS cellular processes and invasion capacity was linked to the reduction of protein levels of miR-34a targeted (proto-)oncogenes including SIRT1, c-MET, and CDK6. Moreover, orthotopic OS xenograft tumor growth was repressed to a significantly greater degree in mouse models when miR-34a prodrug and doxorubicin were co-administered intravenously. In addition, multiple doses of miR-34a prodrug and doxorubicin had no or minimal effects on mouse blood chemistry profiles. The results demonstrate that combination of doxorubicin chemotherapy and miR-34a replacement therapy produces synergistic antiproliferative effects and it is more effective than monotherapy in suppressing OS xenograft tumor growth. These findings support the development of mechanism-based combination therapy to combat OS and bioengineered miR-34a prodrug represents a new natural miRNA agent.",Biochemical pharmacology
1,MiR-34a-5p promotes multi-chemoresistance of osteosarcoma through down-regulation of the DLL1 gene.,"MiR-34a-5p has been implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of several types of cancer. However, the role of miR-34a-5p in osteosarcoma (OS) remains largely unknown. This study was performed in two multi-chemosensitive (G-292 and MG63.2) and two resistant (SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS) OS cell lines. MiR-34a-5p promotes OS multi-chemoresistance via its repression of the Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1) gene, the ligand of the Notch pathway, and thus negatively correlates with OS chemoresistance. The siRNA-mediated repression of the DLL1 gene suppressed cell apoptosis and de-sensitized G-292 and MG63.2 cells, while overexpression of DLL1 sensitized SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS cells to drug-induced cell death. In agreement with the changes in the drug-induced cell death, the activity of the ATF2/ATF3/ATF4 signaling pathway was significantly altered by a forced reversal of miR-34a-5p or DLL1 levels in OS cells. DLL1 is a target of miR-34a-5p and negatively regulates the multi-chemoresistance of OS. This study suggested that miR-34a-5p, DLL1 and the ATF2/ATF3/ATF4 signaling pathway-associated genes are the potential diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets for an effective chemotherapy of OS. Our results also provide novel insights into the effective chemotherapy for OS patients.",Scientific reports
2,The potential combinational effect of miR-34a with celecoxib in osteosarcoma.,"Advanced osteosarcoma (OS) is usually treated by preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy, but there are a very limited number of active agents. Celecoxib (Cel) is a COX-2-selective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug and its antitumoral effect has been shown widely in a variety of cancers including OS cells in vitro. However, the potential combinational effect of Cel with other biological therapy has not been reported in OS cells. In this study, the effects of Cel, miR-34a mimics, and their combination on cell proliferation (MTT assay), migration (in-vitro scratch assay), invasion (transwell assay), mRNA (real-time PCR), and protein (Western blot) expression of associated signal transductions were investigated in cultured MG63 cells. The results showed that miR-34a mimics transfection and Cel treatment significantly decreased cell viability, migration, and invasion in MG63 cells, with their combination being more effective. In contrast, miR-34a inhibitors transfection exerted an effect opposite to miR-34a mimics on cell viability, migration, and invasion. The antitumoral effects of miR-34a, Cel, and their combination were observed in significant up-regulated expression of PTEN and GSK-3β, down-regulated expression of ROCK1, Notch1, and MMP9 as well as Akt Ser phosphorylation. Our data suggested that miR-34a exerts a combinational effect with Cel on the cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in OS cells through regulating Notch1/ROCK1-PTEN-Akt-GSK-3β signaling and MMP9 gene expression.",Anti-cancer drugs
3,The miR-34a-5p promotes the multi-chemoresistance of osteosarcoma via repression of the AGTR1 gene.,"Background: Chemoresistance hinders the curative cancer chemotherapy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key players in diverse biological processes including the chemoresistance of cancers. Methods: A RNA-seq-based miR-omic analysis of osteosarcoma (OS) cells was performed to detect the levels of miR-34a-5p. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that AGTR1 is one of the target genes of miR-34a-5p. The mRNA and protein levels of AGTR1 were detected in both the miR-34a-5p-mimic transfected G-292 and miR-34a-5p-antagomiR transfected SJSA-1 cells. The involvement of AGTR1 with OS chemoresistance was validated by the experiments with siRNA-mediated repression or overexpression of the AGTR1 gene. Results: We showed that miR-34a-5p promotes the multi- chemoresistance of OS. The angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1) gene, is one of the targets of miR-34a-5p in OS and thus negatively correlates with OS chemoresistance by systematic investigations of a multi-drug sensitive (G-292) and resistant (SJSA-1) OS cell lines. Down-regulation of the AGTR1 expression by siRNA passivates G-292 cells and suppresses cell apoptosis, while over-expression of AGTR1 sensitizes SJSA-1 cells and thus promotes the drug-triggered cell death. Conclusions: The miR-34a-5p and its target gene AGTR1 are the potential targets for an effective chemotherapy of OS. Our results also provide novel insights into the effective chemotherapy for OS patients.",BMC cancer
4,MiR-34a-5p promotes the multi-drug resistance of osteosarcoma by targeting the CD117 gene.,"An association has been reported between miR-34a-5p and several types of cancer. Specifically, in this study, using systematic observations of multi-drug sensitive (G-292 and MG63.2) and resistant (SJSA-1 and MNNG/HOS) osteosarcoma (OS) cell lines, we showed that miR-34a-5p promotes the multi-drug resistance of OS through the receptor tyrosine kinase CD117, a direct target of miR-34a-5p. Consistently, the siRNA-mediated repression of CD117 in G-292 and MG63.2 cells led to a similar phenotype that exhibited all of the miR-34a-5p mimic-triggered changes. In addition, the activity of the MEF2 signaling pathway was drastically altered by the forced changes in the miR-34a-5p or CD117 level in OS cells. Furthermore, si-CD117 suppressed the enhanced colony and sphere formation, which is in agreement with the characteristics of a cancer stem marker. Taken together, our data established CD117 as a direct target of miR-34-5p and demonstrated that this regulation interferes with several CD117-mediated effects on OS cells. In addition to providing new mechanistic insights, our results will provide an approach for diagnosing and chemotherapeutically treating OS.",Oncotarget
5,MicroRNA-34a inhibits tumor invasion and metastasis in osteosarcoma partly by effecting C-IAP2 and Bcl-2.,"Osteosarcoma is a common primary malignant bone tumor that occurs mainly in children and adolescents. Recent evidence has demonstrated that miR-34a is involved in the invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma. This study aims to explore the effect of biological behavior of miR-34a on osteosarcoma. First, we collect osteosarcoma and adjacent specimens, and the relative expression of miR-34a and C-IAP2 messenger RNA was quantitated by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, miR-34a stimulant is synthesized and transfected onto osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. The effect of overexpression of miR-34a on osteosarcoma was detected by colony-forming assay, Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate Apoptosis Detection Kit I, Transwell assay, and animal experiment in vivo. Finally, the relative levels of C-IAP2 and Bcl-2 protein were checked by western blot, and the activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 was tested by spectrophotometry assay. In conclusion, miR-34a was downregulated in osteosarcoma cells. And the expression of C-IAP2 and Bcl-2 protein was drastically inhibited, and the activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 were significantly increased after transfecting miR-34a onto osteosarcoma MG-63 cells. And the overexpression of miR-34a can inhibit cell invasion and metastasis, promote cell apoptosis, and arrest cells in G0/G1 period. And the animal experiment in vivo demonstrated that the overexpression of miR-34a could significantly inhibit the growth of osteosarcoma in animal skin. Taken together, we indicated that miR-34a can inhibit tumor invasion and metastasis in osteosarcoma, and its mechanism may be partly related to downregulating the expression of C-IAP2 and Bcl-2 protein directly or indirectly.",Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine
6,The Microtubule Network and Cell Death Are Regulated by an miR-34a/Stathmin 1/betaIII-Tubulin Axis.,"MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) is a master regulator of signaling networks that maintains normal physiology and disease and is currently in development as a miRNA-based therapy for cancer. Prior studies have reported low miR-34a expression in osteosarcoma; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-34a activity in osteosarcoma are not well-defined. Therefore, this study evaluated the role of miR-34a in regulating signal transduction pathways that influence cell death in osteosarcoma. Levels of miR-34a were attenuated in human osteosarcoma cells and xenografts of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC). Bioinformatics predictions identified stathmin 1 (STMN1) as a potential miR-34a target. Biotin pull-down assay and luciferase reporter analysis confirmed miR-34a target interactions within the STMN1 mRNA 3'-untranslated region. Overexpression of miR-34a in osteosarcoma cells suppressed STMN1 expression and reduced cell growth in vitro Restoration of miR-34a led to microtubule destabilization and increased βIII-tubulin expression, with corresponding G1-G2 phase cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Knockdown of the Sp1 transcription factor, by siRNA silencing, also upregulated βIII-tubulin expression in osteosarcoma cells, suggesting that miR-34a indirectly affects Sp1. Validating the coordinating role of miR-34a in microtubule destabilization, when miR-34a was combined with either microtubule inhibitors or chemotherapy, STMN1 phosphorylation was suppressed and there was greater cytotoxicity in osteosarcoma cells. These results demonstrate that miR-34a directly represses STMN1 gene and protein expression and upregulates βIII-tubulin, leading to disruption of the microtubule network and cell death.Implications: The miR-34a/STMN1/βIII-tubulin axis maintains the microtubule cytoskeleton in osteosarcoma, and combining miR-34a with microtubule inhibitors can be investigated as a novel therapeutic strategy.

7,MiR-34a regulates the invasive capacity of canine osteosarcoma cell lines.,"Background: Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common bone tumor in children and dogs; however, no substantial improvement in clinical outcome has occurred in either species over the past 30 years. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and play a fundamental role in cancer. The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential contribution of miR-34a loss to the biology of canine OSA, a well-established spontaneous model of the human disease. Methodology and principal findings: RT-qPCR demonstrated that miR-34a expression levels were significantly reduced in primary canine OSA tumors and canine OSA cell lines as compared to normal canine osteoblasts. In canine OSA cell lines stably transduced with empty vector or pre-miR-34a lentiviral constructs, overexpression of miR-34a inhibited cellular invasion and migration but had no effect on cell proliferation or cell cycle distribution. Transcriptional profiling of canine OSA8 cells possessing enforced miR-34a expression demonstrated dysregulation of numerous genes, including significant down-regulation of multiple putative targets of miR-34a. Moreover, gene ontology analysis of down-regulated miR-34a target genes showed enrichment of several biological processes related to cell invasion and motility. Lastly, we validated changes in miR-34a putative target gene expression, including decreased expression of KLF4, SEM3A, and VEGFA transcripts in canine OSA cells overexpressing miR-34a and identified KLF4 and VEGFA as direct target genes of miR-34a. Concordant with these data, primary canine OSA tumor tissues demonstrated increased expression levels of putative miR-34a target genes. Conclusions: These data demonstrate that miR-34a contributes to invasion and migration in canine OSA cells and suggest that loss of miR-34a may promote a pattern of gene expression contributing to the metastatic phenotype in canine OSA.",PloS one
8,miR-34a exerts as a key regulator in the dedifferentiation of osteosarcoma via PAI-1-Sox2 axis.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is a malignant bone cancer with severe chromosomal abnormalities and genetic aberrations. Our previous work reported the dedifferentiation of OS, which is related to poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanism that regulates OS dedifferentiation is still a subject of exploration. Emerging evidence has suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with the pathogenesis of OS and could potentially be developed for use as diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic strategies. In the present study, we intended to illustrate the role of miR-34a in the dedifferentiation of OS. Upregulation of miR-34a was observed while OS cells were induced into stem-like phenotype. Notably, inhibition of miR-34a could promote the reprogramming transition of OS. Further exploration on the downstream network of miR-34a identified that blocking plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) expression could restrain OS dedifferentiation into cancer stem-like cells by downregulating SRY-related-HMG box (Sox) 2. We also showed that Sox2 overexpression rescued the suppression phenotype driven by PAI-1 inhibition. Conversely, PAI-1 inhibitor (PAI-039) could suppress the upregulation of Sox2 expression caused by miR-34a inhibition. Be applying bone extracellular matrix (BEM)-OS models, we demonstrated the phenotypic heterogeneity of OS cells, consistent with a strong concordance between PAI-1 and Sox2 expression levels. Taken together, our findings proved miR-34a to be a bona fide suppressor involved in the regulation of OS dedifferentiation. Targeting miR-34a or its direct target PAI-1 could offer new strategies for OS treatment.",Cell death & disease
9,Knockdown of MALAT1 inhibits osteosarcoma progression via regulating the miR-34a/cyclin D1 axis.,"Long non‑coding (lnc)RNAs have been demonstrated to be involved in the development of various types of cancers, such as osteosarcoma (OS). Long non‑coding (lnc)RNA metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) expression was reported to be highly expressed in OS and promoted the development of this disease; however, the underlying molecular mechanism by which MALAT1 promotes the progression of OS requires further investigation. In the present study, the expression of MALAT1 and miR‑34a was detected by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The abundance of cyclin D1 (CCND1) was detected by RT‑qPCR and western blotting. Cell viability, migration and invasion were examined by MTT and Transwell assays. The interaction between miR‑34a and MALAT1 or CCND1 was probed by a dual luciferase reporter assay and RNA immunoprecipitation. Xenograft tumor assay was performed to verify the roles of MALAT1 and miR‑34a in tumor growth in vivo. The results demonstrated that MALAT1 and CCND1 mRNA expression levels were upregulated and miR‑34a was downregulated in OS tissues and cells. Additionally, MALAT1 expression was correlated with tumor size, clinical stage and distant metastasis in patients with OS. In addition, MALAT1 promoted OS cell viability, invasion and migration, while MALAT1 silencing exhibited opposing effects. Moreover, MALAT1 functioned as a ceRNA to suppress miR‑34a expression and in turn upregulate CCND1 in OS cells. Rescue experiments further demonstrated that MALAT1 knockdown partially reversed anti‑miR‑34a‑mediated promotion on OS cell viability, migration and invasion; overexpression of CCND1 partially reversed the effects of MALAT1 silencing on OS progression. Furthermore, in vivo experiments also revealed that MALAT1 promoted OS tumor growth via miR‑34a inhibition and upregulating the expression of CCND1. In conclusion, the present study suggested that MALAT1 exerted its oncogenic function in OS by regulating the miR‑34a/CCND1 axis in OS, which may provide novel insight into the diagnosis and therapy for OS.",International journal of oncology

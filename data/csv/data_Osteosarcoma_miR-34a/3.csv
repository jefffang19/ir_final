0,MicroRNA-34a promotes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis and suppresses cell adhesion by targeting DUSP1 in osteosarcoma.,"MicroRNAs are often deregulated in most cancer types and have important functions in carcinogenesis and cancer progression. Here, we studied the function of microRNA-34 (miR-34a) in osteosarcoma MG63 and U-2OS cells by expressed with pre-miR-34a, anti-miR-34a and corresponding negative controls, respectively. Cells proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis was measured by MTT and flow cytometry assay. The effect of miR-34a on DUSP1 expression was evaluated by luciferase assays, real-time PCR and western blot assay. The data showed that miR-34a reduced the proliferation of MG63 cells through prompting cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, cell apoptosis, and suppressed cell adhesion ability. Whereas anti-miR-34a increases U-2OS cell proliferation by preventing cell apoptosis, and promotes cell adhesion. Finally, we identified Dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) as the target gene of miR-34a in osteosarcoma cells and confirmed that DUSP1 enhanced the proliferation through inhibiting cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis, and inhibits the decreased cell adhesion induced by miR-34a. However, inhibition of DUSP1 resulted in substantially decreased proliferation and adhesion, and cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and cell apoptosis similar to that observed with miR-34a in U-2OS cells. Our findings find out an important function of miR-34a as a novel tumor-suppressor in osteosarcoma pathogenesis through inhibition of DUSP1.",American journal of translational research
1,MicroRNA-34a inhibits the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells both in vitro and in vivo.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenously expressed, small noncoding RNAs, which suppress its target mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level. Studies have demonstrated that miR-34a, which is a direct target of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, functions as a tumor suppressor and is associated with the tumor growth and metastasis of various human malignances. However, the role of miR-34a in osteosarcoma has not been totally elucidated. In the present study, the effects of miR-34a on osteosarcoma and the possible mechanism by which miR-34a affected the tumor growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma were investigated. Methodology/principal finding: Over-expression of miR-34a partially inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells in vitro, as well as the tumor growth and pulmonary metastasis of osteosarcoma cells in vivo. c-Met is a target of miR-34a, and regulates the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Osteosarcoma cells over-expressing miR-34a exhibited a significant decrease in the expression levels of c-Met mRNA and protein simultaneously. Finally, the results from bioinformatics analysis demonstrated that there were multiple putative targets of miR-34a that may be associated with the proliferation and metastasis of osteosarcoma, including factors in Wnt and Notch signaling pathways. Conclusion/significance: The results presented in this study demonstrated that over-expression of miR-34a could inhibit the tumor growth and metastasis of osteosarcoma probably through down regulating c-Met. And there are other putative miR-34a target genes beside c-Met which could potentially be key players in the development of osteosarcoma. Since pulmonary metastases are responsible for mortality of patient carrying osteosarcoma, miR-34a may prove to be a promising gene therapeutic agent. It will be interesting to further investigate the mechanism by which miR-34a functions as a tumor suppressor gene in osteosarcoma.",PloS one
2,Genetically engineered pre-microRNA-34a prodrug suppresses orthotopic osteosarcoma xenograft tumor growth via the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor in children, and microRNA-34a (miR-34a) replacement therapy represents a new treatment strategy. This study was to define the effectiveness and safety profiles of a novel bioengineered miR-34a prodrug in orthotopic OS xenograft tumor mouse model. Highly purified pre-miR-34a prodrug significantly inhibited the proliferation of human 143B and MG-63 cells in a dose dependent manner and to much greater degrees than controls, which was attributed to induction of apoptosis and G2 cell cycle arrest. Inhibition of OS cell growth and invasion were associated with release of high levels of mature miR-34a from pre-miR-34a prodrug and consequently reduction of protein levels of many miR-34a target genes including SIRT1, BCL2, c-MET, and CDK6. Furthermore, intravenous administration of in vivo-jetPEI formulated miR-34a prodrug significantly reduced OS tumor growth in orthotopic xenograft mouse models. In addition, mouse blood chemistry profiles indicated that therapeutic doses of bioengineered miR-34a prodrug were well tolerated in these animals. The results demonstrated that bioengineered miR-34a prodrug was effective to control OS tumor growth which involved the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, supporting the development of bioengineered RNAs as a novel class of large molecule therapeutic agents.",Scientific reports
3,Long noncoding RNA NEAT1 regulates the development of osteosarcoma through sponging miR-34a-5p to mediate HOXA13 expression as a competitive endogenous RNA.,"Background: Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) exerts a potential regulatory role in tumorigenesis. LncRNA NEAT1 expression remains high in osteosarcoma tissues. However, its biological mechanism in osteosarcoma remains unknown. Methods: In this study, NEAT1 expression in osteosarcoma cells was detected by qRT-PCR. Proliferative and apoptosis potentials of osteosarcoma cells were determined by CCK-8 assay and Flow Cytometry, respectively. We identified the potential target of NEAT1 through bioinformatics and dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. Furthermore, their interaction and functions in regulating the development of osteosarcoma were clarified by Western blot and RIP assay. Results: Our results demonstrated a high expression of NEAT1 in osteosarcoma tissues and cells. Overexpression of NEAT1 markedly accelerated proliferative and reduced apoptosis potentials of osteosarcoma cells. Besides, NEAT1 could positively regulate the expression of HOXA13 by competing with miR-34a-5p. Conclusion: These results indicated that NEAT1 participated in the development of osteosarcoma as a ceRNA to competitively bind to miR-34a-5p and thus mediate HOXA13 expression.",Molecular genetics & genomic medicine
4,MicroRNAs and Potential Targets in Osteosarcoma: Review.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer in children and young adults. Surgery and multi-agent chemotherapy are the standard treatment regimens for this disease. New therapies are being investigated to improve overall survival in patients. Molecular targets that actively modulate cell processes, such as cell-cycle control, cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis, have been studied, but it remains a challenge to develop novel, effective-targeted therapies to treat this heterogeneous and complex disease. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play critical roles in regulating cell processes including growth, development, and disease. miRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors to regulate gene and protein expression. Several studies have demonstrated the involvement of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma with the potential for development in disease diagnostics and therapeutics. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on the role of miRNAs and their target genes and evaluate their potential use as therapeutic agents in osteosarcoma. We also summarize the efficacy of inhibition of oncogenic miRNAs or expression of tumor suppressor miRNAs in preclinical models of osteosarcoma. Recent progress on systemic delivery as well as current applications for miRNAs as therapeutic agents has seen the advancement of miR-34a in clinical trials for adult patients with non-resectable primary liver cancer or metastatic cancer with liver involvement. We suggest a global approach to the understanding of the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma may identify candidate miRNAs as promising biomarkers for this rare disease.",Frontiers in pediatrics
5,A polymorphism site in the pre-miR-34a coding region reduces miR-34a expression and promotes osteosarcoma cell proliferation and migration.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most prevalent primary malignant bone tumor in children and young adults, its complex etiology involving a combination of environmental and genetic factors. MicroRNA (miRNA) is a short, non‑coding regulatory RNA molecule that represses gene expression by imperfectly base‑pairing to the 3' untranslated region of target mRNAs. Evidence has shown that alterations in the expression of miRNA are involved in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of human cancers. It is believed that miRNAs function both as tumor suppressors and oncogenes during cancer development. In the present study, three tumor-associated miRNAs (miR‑21, miR‑34a and miR‑146a) coding regions were screened in Chinese‑Han OS patients. A G>A variation in the pre‑miR‑34a coding region was found to be associated with higher OS morbidity. By detecting the mature miR‑34a expression in cells transfected with pre‑miR‑34a expression vectors of different genotypes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, it was demonstrated that the G>A variation reduced miR‑34a expression in vitro. This was in accordance with the data collected from tumor tissue and patient serum samples. Subsequently, a dual‑luciferase reporter assay and western blot analysis were used to detect the site variation effect on the expression of c‑Met, a target gene of miR‑34a. The G>A variation downregulated the suppression of c‑Met in two OS cell lines. Furthermore, it was found that reduced miR‑34a expression decreased the suppression of OS cell proliferation in vitro. In conclusion, the present study established the association between miR‑34a and the risk of suffering OS in a Chinese Han population by identifying one functional single nucleotide polymorphism site in pre‑miR‑34a. These findings may give insight into the mechanism of OS development and create an opportunity to approach the diagnosis and treatment of OS.",Molecular medicine reports
6,miR-34a inhibits the metastasis of osteosarcoma cells by repressing the expression of CD44.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common type of malignant bone tumor in children and adolescents and approximately 30% of patients develop lung metastasis, which is the leading cause of mortality. In this study, we investigated the role of miR-34a in the invasion and metastasis of osteosarcoma cells by examining its expression level and functional pattern in these cells. miR-34a mimics were transfected into the highly metastatic subline, F5M2, and into the F4 subline with low metastatic potential of the paired human osteosarcoma cell line, SOSP‑9607. Cell viability patterns, cell migration and alterations in gene expression levels were assessed by real-time PCR, and changes in protein levels were assessed by immunocytochemistry and western blot analysis. The ectopic overexpression of miR-34a significantly inhibited the migration and invasive ability of osteosarcoma cells by repressing the expression of CD44. These data suggest that miR-34a plays a tumor suppressor role in the metastasis of osteosarcoma cells by repressing the expression of CD44. Of note, studies have also suggested that the CD44 protein correlates with the metastatic potential of several malignant tumors. Therefore, it can be concluded that through the inhibition of CD44 expression levels, miR-34a plays a significant role in the migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells.",Oncology reports
7,miR-34a predicts survival of Ewing's sarcoma patients and directly influences cell chemo-sensitivity and malignancy.,"Identification of factors to detect chemotherapy-resistant tumours at diagnosis is a first priority for risk-adapted therapy in the oncology of children and young adults, where more individualized, effective, and less toxic treatments are highly desirable. In this study, we analysed the miRNAs discriminating Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) patients with different clinical outcomes in order to identify new indicators of prognosis. miRNA expression was investigated in 49 primary EWSs by using the Agilent human miRNA microarray v.2 and/or qRT-PCR. Statistical power of the samples studied for miRNA expression was verified, indicating adequate sample size. Microarray analysis defined a signature of five miRNAs (miR-34a, miR-23a, miR-92a, miR-490-3p, and miR-130b) as an independent predictor of risk for disease progression and survival. Validation analysis in the extended sample set indicated that both miR-34a and miR-490-3p achieved sufficient statistical power to predict prognosis. Results were particularly robust for miR-34a, which appeared associated with either event-free or overall survival and emerged as a significant predictor also after multivariate analysis. Patients with the highest expression of miR-34a did not experience adverse events in 5 years; in contrast, patients with the lowest expression recurred within 2 years. High expression of miR34a can be detected also in paraffin-embedded tissues by in situ hybridization, thus contributing to an easy routine evaluation of this miRNA. Functional analysis of miR-34a in EWS cell lines indicated that when miR-34a expression was enforced, cells were less proliferative, less malignant, and sensitized to doxorubicin and vincristine. Expression of miR-34a could be increased in p53wt cells by treatment with nutlin-3a. Accordingly, nutlin-3a synergizes with doxorubicin. Overall, our data indicate that miR-34a expression is a strong predictor of outcome in EWS. Restoration of miR-34a activity may be useful to decrease malignancy and increase tumour sensitivity to current drugs, so sparing excessive long-term toxicity to EWS patients.",The Journal of pathology
8,"Co-targeting of DNA, RNA, and protein molecules provides optimal outcomes for treating osteosarcoma and pulmonary metastasis in spontaneous and experimental metastasis mouse models.","Metastasis is a major cause of mortality for cancer patients and remains as the greatest challenge in cancer therapy. Driven by multiple factors, metastasis may not be controlled by the inhibition of single target. This study was aimed at assessing the hypothesis that drugs could be rationally combined to co-target critical DNA, RNA and protein molecules to achieve ""saturation attack"" against metastasis. Independent actions of the model drugs DNA-intercalating doxorubicin, RNA-interfering miR-34a and protein-inhibiting sorafenib on DNA replication, RNA translation and protein kinase signaling in highly metastatic, human osteosarcoma 143B cells were demonstrated by the increase of γH2A.X foci formation, reduction of c-MET expression and inhibition of Erk1/2 phosphorylation, respectively, and optimal effects were found for triple-drug combination. Consequently, triple-drug treatment showed a strong synergism in suppressing 143B cell proliferation and the greatest effects in reducing cell invasion. Compared to single- and dual-drug treatment, triple-drug therapy suppressed pulmonary metastases and orthotopic osteosarcoma progression to significantly greater degrees in orthotopic osteosarcoma xenograft/spontaneous metastases mouse models, while none showed significant toxicity. In addition, triple-drug therapy improved the overall survival to the greatest extent in experimental metastases mouse models. These findings demonstrate co-targeting of DNA, RNA and protein molecules as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of metastasis.",Oncotarget
9,Prognostic significance of miR-34a in Ewing sarcoma is associated with cyclin D1 and ki-67 expression.,"Background: At diagnosis, identification of reliable biological indicators of prognosis to allow stratification of patients according to different risks is an important but still unresolved aspect in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma (EWS) patients. This study aimed to explore the role of miR-34A expression on prognosis of EWS patients. Patients and methods: Specimens from 109 patients with non-metastatic EWS treated at the Rizzoli Institute with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (protocols ISG/SSGIII, EW-1, EW-2, EW-REN2, EW-REN3, EW-PILOT) and 17 metastases were studied. Sixty-eight patients (62%) remained disease-free and 41 (38%) relapsed (median follow-up: 67 months, range 9-241 months). Expression of miR-34a and of some of its targets (cyclin D1, bcl-2, SIRT1 and YY1) was evaluated by qRT-PCR using TaqMan MicroRNA Assays and/or by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from the same patients. Results: High expression of miR-34a in localized tumors was significantly related to better event-free and overall survival (P = 0.004). Relevance of miR-34a was confirmed by using different calibrators (normal mesenchymal stem cells and different normal tissues). By multivariate Cox regression analysis, low miR-34a expression as well as nontotal necrosis and high levels of lactate dehydrogenase were all confirmed as independent risk factors associated with poor outcome. Expression of miR-34a was lower in metastases than in primary tumors. It inversely correlated with expression of cyclin D1 and Ki-67. Conclusions: By demonstrating its relationship with clinical outcome, we propose evaluation of miR-34a at diagnosis of EWS patients to allow early risk stratification. Validation of these results would nonetheless ultimately need a prospective assessment.",Annals of oncology : official journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology

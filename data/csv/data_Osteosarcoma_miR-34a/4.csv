0,MicroRNA-199a-3p and microRNA-34a regulate apoptosis in human osteosarcoma cells.,"miRNAs (microRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs [18-25 nt (nucleotides)] that regulate gene expression mainly through affecting post-transcriptional modification. Osteosarcoma is an aggressive sarcoma of the bone characterized by a high level of genetic instability and recurrent DNA deletions and amplifications. miRNAs play an important role in cancer cell growth and migration; however, the potential roles of miRNAs in osteosarcoma remain largely uncharacterized. In this paper, miR-199a and miR-34a were discussed the mechanisms of apoptosis using miRNA mimics in human osteosarcoma cells. The results demonstrated that miR-199a and miR-34a could induce the apoptosis of human osteosarcoma cells via p53 signalling pathway.",Bioscience reports
1,A genetically engineered microRNA-34a prodrug demonstrates anti-tumor activity in a canine model of osteosarcoma.,"Osteosarcoma (OSA) represents the most common primary bone tumor in humans and pet dogs. Little progress has been made with regard to viable treatment options in the past three decades and patients presenting with metastatic disease continue to have a poor prognosis. Recent mouse studies have suggested that microRNA-34a (miR-34a) may have anti-tumor activities in human OSA models. Due to the conservation of microRNA across species, we hypothesized that a bioengineered miR-34a prodrug (tRNA/miR-34a) would have similar effects in canine OSA, providing a valuable preclinical model for development of this therapeutic modality. Using a panel of canine OSA cell lines, we found that tRNA/miR-34a reduced viability, clonogenic growth, and migration and invasion while increasing tumor cell apoptosis. Furthermore, canine OSA cells successfully process the tRNA/miR-34a into mature miR-34a which reduces expression of target proteins such as platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα), Notch1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Additionally, our subcutaneous OSA xenograft model demonstrated in vivo tumor growth delay, increased necrosis and apoptosis by tRNA/miR-34a, and decreased cellular proliferation ability. Taken together, these data support that this novel microRNA-based therapy may possess clinical utility in a spontaneously-occurring large animal model of OSA, which can then serve to inform the clinical development of this therapy for human OSA patients.",PloS one
2,MicroRNA-34a inhibits human osteosarcoma proliferation by downregulating ether a go-go 1 expression.,"Aberrant expression of MicroRNAs (miRNAs) has been implicated in several types of cancer. As a direct target gene of p53, miR-34a has been suggested to mediate the tumor suppressor function of p53. Ether à go-go 1 (Eag1) channel is overexpressed in a variety of cancers and plays important roles in cancer progression. However, the link between miR-34a and Eag1 in cancer is unclear. In this study, we used human osteosarcoma as the model to demonstrate that miR-34a was significantly downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines compared with normal brain tissues and osteoblastic cell line. Next we evaluated the role of miR-34a in the regulation of osteosarcoma cell proliferation by CCK-8 and colony formation assays. The results showed that overexpression of miR-34a inhibited the proliferation of MG-63 and Saos-2 cells. Furthermore, xenograft nude mice model showed that miR-34a inhibited osteosarcoma growth in vivo. Mechanistically, we found that overexpression of miR-34a led to decreased Eag1 expression in osteosarcoma cells while inhibition of miR-34a increased Eag1 expression. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-34a could inhibit osteosarcoma growth via the down regulation of Eag1 expression.",International journal of medical sciences
3,MicroRNAs as Biomarkers in Canine Osteosarcoma: A New Future?,"Sarcomas are frequent in dogs and canine species are excellent animal models for studying the human counterpart. However, osteosarcomas are a rare form of sarcoma with high death rates in humans and dogs. miRNAs are small endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. The discovery of miRNAs could give a contribute in the diagnosis and prognosis of different types of tumors in animal species, as already in humans. The differentiated expression of miRNAs is a frequent finding in cancers and is related to their pathogenesis in many cases. Most canine and human sarcomas show similar miRNA aberrations. Lower levels of miR-1 and miR-133b in canine osteosarcoma tissues were found to increase tumorigenesis through a higher expression of their target genes MET and MCL1. The overexpression of miR-9 promotes a metastatic phenotype in canine osteosarcomas and its capacity as a prognostic biomarker for the disease is currently being evaluated. MicroRNAs at the 14q32 locus could be used as prognostic biomarkers, since their decreased expression has been associated with poor prognosis in canine and human osteosarcomas. Furthermore, a decreased expression of miR-34a in osteosarcoma tumour cells has been associated with shorter disease-free survival times and its reintroduction as a synthetic prodrug shows good potential as a novel therapeutic target to fight the disease. Circulating miR-214 and miR-126 are significantly increased in a broad-spectrum cancer and have the ability to successfully predict the prognosis of dogs. However, further studies are needed to make the use of miRNAs as biomarkers a common practice.",Veterinary sciences
4,"Diallyl trisulfide inhibits proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis of osteosarcoma cells by switching on suppressor microRNAs and inactivating of Notch-1 signaling.","Notch signaling pathway plays critical roles in human cancers, including osteosarcoma, suggesting that the discovery of specific agents targeting Notch would be extremely valuable for osteosarcoma. Our previous studies have shown that diallyl trisulfide (DATS) inhibits proliferation of osteosarcoma cells by triggering cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we found that DATS suppressed cell survival, wound-healing capacity, invasion and angiogenesis in osteosarcoma cells. These effects were associated with decreased expression of Notch-1 and its downstream genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix metalloproteinases, as well as increased expression of a panel of tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRNAs), including miR-34a, miR-143, miR-145 and miR-200b/c that are typically lost in osteosarcoma. We also found that reexpression of miR-34a and miR-200b by transfection led to reduced expression of Notch-1, resulting in the inhibition of osteosarcoma cell proliferation, invasion and angiogenesis. These results clearly suggest that DATS inhibited osteosarcoma growth and aggressiveness via a novel mechanism targeting a Notch-miRNA regulatory circuit. Our data provide the first evidence that the downregulation of Notch-1 and reexpression of miRNAs by DATS may be an effective approach for the treatment of osteosarcoma.",Carcinogenesis
5,MicroRNA expression in relation with clinical evolution of osteosarcoma.,"Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor. Early diagnosis remains a major challenge, mainly because of the lack of specific biomarkers. We performed miRNAs expression analysis through qPCR in affected and paired healthy bone derived from osteosarcoma patients. Hierarchical clustering using the top ten miRNAs with differential expression showed two main clusters. One integrated by patients with the presence of metastasis or relapse and the other without these complications. Further pathway enrichment analysis reduced to four main miRNAs, hsa-miR-486-3p, hsa-miR-355-5p, hsa-miR-34a-5p and hsa-miR-1228-3p. Afterwards, we compared patients with and without metastasis, the function enrichment analysis along with review of relevant literature, showed that hsa-miR-93-5p and hsa-miR-28-5p were associated with metastasis development. Our results support the relevance of miRNAs in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma and contribute with evidence regarding the potential role of miRNAs as potential biomarkers. More studies are needed to define the most informative miRNAs in osteosarcoma patients.","Pathology, research and practice"

7,Integrated analysis of lncRNA-associated ceRNA network identified potential regulatory interactions in osteosarcoma.,"This study aimed to identify potential therapeutic targets in osteosarcoma (OS) through the network analysis of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). The differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMIs) and mRNAs (DEMs) were identified between OS cell lines and human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from the data deposited under GSE70415 using limma package. Functional analysis of DEMs was performed using DAVID and clusterProfiler to identify significantly enriched Gene Ontology biological processes and KEGG pathways, respectively. The DEMI-DEM interaction network was constructed using Cytoscape. LncRNA-miRNA interactions were predicted using starBase database. The ceRNA regulatory network was constructed by integrating mRNAs, miRNAs, and lncRNAs, and functional enrichment analysis was performed for the genes involved. The analysis revealed a total of 326 DEMs and 54 DEMIs between OS cells and hMSCs. We identified several novel therapeutic targets involved in the progression and metastasis of OS, such as CBX7, RAD9A, SNHG7 and miR-34a-5p. The miRNA, miR-543 (target gene: CBX7) was found to be associated with the pathway Mucin type O-glycan biosynthesis. Using the ceRNA network, we established the following regulatory interactions: NEAT1/miR-543/CBX7, SNHG7/miR-34a-5p/RAD9A, and XIST/miR-34a-5p/RAD9A. CBX7, RAD9A, lncRNA SNHG7, miR-543, and miR-34a-5p may be explored as novel therapeutic targets for treatment of OS.",Genetics and molecular biology
8,p53-dependent activation of microRNA-34a in response to etoposide-induced DNA damage in osteosarcoma cell lines not impaired by dominant negative p53 expression.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary malignant bone tumor and prevalently occurs in the second decade of life. Etoposide, a chemotherapeutic agent used in combined treatments of recurrent human OS, belongs to the topoisomerase inhibitor family and causes DNA breakage. In this study we evaluated the cascade of events determined by etoposide-induced DNA damage in OS cell lines with different p53 status focusing on methylation status and expression of miR-34a that modulate tumor cell growth and cell cycle progression. Wild-type p53 U2-OS cells and U2-OS cells expressing dominant-negative form of p53 (U2- OS175) were more sensitive to etoposide than p53-deficient MG63 and Saos-2 cells, showing increased levels of unmethylated miR-34a, reduced expression of CDK4 and cell cycle arrest in G1 phase. In contrast, MG63 and Saos-2 cell lines presented aberrant methylation of miR-34a promoter gene with no miR-34a induction after etoposide treatment, underlining the close connection between p53 expression and miR-34a methylation status. Consistently, in p53siRNA transfected U2-OS cells we observed loss of miR-34a induction after etoposide exposure associated with a partial gain of gene methylation and cell cycle progress towards G2/M phase. Our results suggest that the open and unmethylated conformation of the miR-34a gene may be regulated by p53 able to bind the gene promoter. In conclusion, cell response to etoposide-induced DNA damage was not compromised in cells with dominant-negative p53 expression.",PloS one
9,CD99 regulates neural differentiation of Ewing sarcoma cells through miR-34a-Notch-mediated control of NF-kappaB signaling.,"Sarcomas are mesenchymal tumors characterized by blocked differentiation process. In Ewing sarcoma (EWS) both CD99 and EWS-FLI1 concur to oncogenesis and inhibition of differentiation. Here, we demonstrate that uncoupling CD99 from EWS-FLI1 by silencing the former, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling is inhibited and the neural differentiation program is re-established. NF-κB inhibition passes through miR-34a-mediated repression of Notch pathway. CD99 counteracts EWS-FLI1 in controlling NF-κB signaling through the miR-34a, which is increased and secreted into exosomes released by CD99-silenced EWS cells. Delivery of exosomes from CD99-silenced cells was sufficient to induce neural differentiation in recipient EWS cells through miR-34a inhibition of Notch-NF-κB signaling. Notably, even the partial delivery of CD99 small interfering RNA may have a broad effect on the entire tumor cell population owing to the spread operated by their miR-34a-enriched exosomes, a feature opening to a new therapeutic option.",Oncogene

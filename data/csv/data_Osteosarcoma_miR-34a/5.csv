0,Long noncoding RNA CASC11 promotes osteosarcoma metastasis by suppressing degradation of snail mRNA.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone tumor in adolescents. Dysregulation of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) is associated with the cancer progression, of which cancer susceptibility candidate 11 (CASC11) has been indicated as an oncogene in several human cancers. However, the underlying mechanisms by which CASC11 contributes to OS metastasis remain undetermined. Here, we found that CASC11 expression in OS tissues was markedly higher than that in noncancerous tissues. Clinical association analysis revealed that high CASC11 expression correlated with clinical stage, distant metastasis and poor prognosis of OS patients. Gain- and loss-of-function assays demonstrated that CASC11 promoted migration, invasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis of OS cells in vitro and in vivo. CASC11 associated with the EMT inducer Snail mRNA and increased its stability. Association of CASC11 with Snail mRNA blocked the repressing effect of miR-122, miR-145, miR-211, miR-34a and miR-137 on Snail. Moreover, CASC11-specific siRNAs significantly inhibit tumor metastasis in vivo. Taken together, our findings suggest that CASC11 may be a candidate prognostic biomarker and a novel therapeutic target for OS.",American journal of cancer research
1,Identification of Dormancy-Associated MicroRNAs for the Design of Osteosarcoma-Targeted Dendritic Polyglycerol Nanopolyplexes.,"The presence of dormant, microscopic cancerous lesions poses a major obstacle for the treatment of metastatic and recurrent cancers. While it is well-established that microRNAs play a major role in tumorigenesis, their involvement in tumor dormancy has yet to be fully elucidated. We established and comprehensively characterized pairs of dormant and fast-growing human osteosarcoma models. Using these pairs of mouse tumor models, we identified three novel regulators of osteosarcoma dormancy: miR-34a, miR-93, and miR-200c. This report shows that loss of these microRNAs occurs during the switch from dormant avascular into fast-growing angiogenic phenotype. We validated their downregulation in patients' tumor samples compared to normal bone, making them attractive candidates for osteosarcoma therapy. Successful delivery of miRNAs is a challenge; hence, we synthesized an aminated polyglycerol dendritic nanocarrier, dPG-NH2, and designed dPG-NH2-microRNA polyplexes to target cancer. Reconstitution of these microRNAs using dPG-NH2 polyplexes into Saos-2 and MG-63 cells, which generate fast-growing osteosarcomas, reduced the levels of their target genes, MET proto-oncogene, hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, and moesin, critical to cancer angiogenesis and cancer cells' migration. We further demonstrate that these microRNAs attenuate the angiogenic capabilities of fast-growing osteosarcomas in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with each of these microRNAs using dPG-NH2 significantly prolonged the dormancy period of fast-growing osteosarcomas in vivo. Taken together, these findings suggest that nanocarrier-mediated delivery of microRNAs involved in osteosarcoma tumor-host interactions can induce a dormant-like state.",ACS nano
2,HSP90 regulates osteosarcoma cell apoptosis by targeting the p53/TCF-1-mediated transcriptional network.,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone tumor that occurs predominantly in children and teenagers. Although many genes, such as p53 and Rb1, have been shown to be mutated, deregulation of the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is frequently observed in OS. We recently demonstrated that heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is involved in the regulation of runt-related transcription factor 2 via the AKT/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway in OS. However, the precise role of T cell factors/lymphoid enhancer-binding factor (TCFs/LEF) family members, which are the major binding complex of β-catenin, in OS is poorly understood. In the present study, we first demonstrated that TCF-1 is overexpressed in OS compared with other bone tumors. Knockdown of TCF-1 significantly induced cell cycle arrest, severe DNA damage, and subsequent caspase-3-dependent apoptosis. Interestingly, coexpression of HSP90 and TCF-1 was observed in OS, and mechanistically, we demonstrated that TCF-1 expression is regulated by HSP90 either through a β-catenin-dependent mechanism or a direct degradation of the proteasome. We also found that overexpression of TCF-1 partially abolishes the apoptosis induced by HSP90 inhibition. Furthermore, we provided evidence that p53, but not miR-34a, plays a crucial role in the HSP90-regulated TCF-1 expression and subsequent apoptosis. Given the diverse combination regimens of HSP90 inhibition with some other treatments, we propose that the p53 status and the expression level of TCF-1 should be taken into consideration to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of HSP90 inhibition.",Journal of cellular physiology
3,Integrated approaches to miRNAs target definition: time-series analysis in an osteosarcoma differentiative model.,"Background: microRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding RNAs involved in the fine regulation of several cellular processes by inhibiting their target genes at post-transcriptional level. Osteosarcoma (OS) is a tumor thought to be related to a molecular blockade of the normal process of osteoblast differentiation. The current paper explores temporal transcriptional modifications comparing an osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, and clones stably transfected with CD99, a molecule which was found to drive OS cells to terminally differentiate. Methods: Parental cell line and CD99 transfectants were cultured up to 14 days in differentiating medium. In this setting, OS cells were profiled by gene and miRNA expression arrays. Integration of gene and miRNA profiling was performed by both sequence complementarity and expression correlation. Further enrichment and network analyses were carried out to focus on the modulated pathways and on the interactions between transcriptome and miRNome. To track the temporal transcriptional modification, a PCA analysis with differentiated human MSC was performed. Results: We identified a strong (about 80 %) gene down-modulation where reversion towards the osteoblast-like phenotype matches significant enrichment in TGFbeta signaling players like AKT1 and SMADs. In parallel, we observed the modulation of several cancer-related microRNAs like miR-34a, miR-26b or miR-378. To decipher their impact on the modified transcriptional program in CD99 cells, we correlated gene and microRNA time-series data miR-34a, in particular, was found to regulate a distinct subnetwork of genes with respect to the rest of the other differentially expressed miRs and it appeared to be the main mediator of several TGFbeta signaling genes at initial and middle phases of differentiation. Integration studies further highlighted the involvement of TGFbeta pathway in the differentiation of OS cells towards osteoblasts and its regulation by microRNAs. Conclusions: These data underline that the expression of miR-34a and down-modulation of TGFbeta signaling emerge as pivotal events to drive CD99-mediated reversal of malignancy and activation of differentiation in OS cells. Our results describe crucial and specific interacting actors providing and supporting their relevance as potential targets for therapeutic differentiative strategies.",BMC medical genomics
4,Ewing's Sarcoma: An Analysis of miRNA Expression Profiles and Target Genes in Paraffin-Embedded Primary Tumor Tissue.,"The molecular mechanism responsible for Ewing's Sarcoma (ES) remains largely unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs able to regulate gene expression, are deregulated in tumors and may serve as a tool for diagnosis and prediction. However, the status of miRNAs in ES has not yet been thoroughly investigated. This study compared global miRNAs expression in paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples from 20 ES patients, affected by primary untreated tumors, with miRNAs expressed in normal human mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) by microarray analysis. A miRTarBase database was used to identify the predicted target genes for differentially expressed miRNAs. The miRNAs microarray analysis revealed distinct patterns of miRNAs expression between ES samples and normal MSCs. 58 of the 954 analyzed miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in ES samples compared to MSCs. Moreover, the qRT-PCR analysis carried out on three selected miRNAs showed that miR-181b, miR-1915 and miR-1275 were significantly aberrantly regulated, confirming the microarray results. Bio-database analysis identified BCL-2 as a bona fide target gene of the miR-21, miR-181a, miR-181b, miR-29a, miR-29b, miR-497, miR-195, miR-let-7a, miR-34a and miR-1915. Using paraffin-embedded tissues from ES patients, this study has identified several potential target miRNAs and one gene that might be considered a novel critical biomarker for ES pathogenesis.",International journal of molecular sciences
5,p53-Responsive micrornas 192 and 215 are capable of inducing cell cycle arrest.,"microRNAs provide a novel layer of regulation for gene expression by interfering with the stability and/or translation of specific target mRNAs. Overall levels of microRNAs are frequently down-regulated in cancer cells, and reducing general microRNA processing increases cancerogenesis in transgenic models, suggesting that at least some microRNAs might act as effectors in tumor suppression. Accordingly, the tumor suppressor p53 up-regulates miR-34a, a microRNA that contributes to apoptosis and acute senescence. Here, we used array hybridization to find that p53 induces two additional, mutually related clusters of microRNAs, leading to the up-regulation of miR-192, miR-194, and miR-215. The same microRNAs were detected at high levels in normal colon tissue but were severely reduced in many colon cancer samples. On the other hand, miR-192 and its cousin miR-215 can each contribute to enhanced CDKN1A/p21 levels, colony suppression, cell cycle arrest, and cell detachment from a solid support. These effects were partially dependent on the presence of wild-type p53. Antagonizing endogenous miR-192 attenuated 5-fluorouracil-induced accumulation of p21. Hence, miR-192 and miR-215 can act as effectors as well as regulators of p53; they seem to suppress cancerogenesis through p21 accumulation and cell cycle arrest.",Cancer research

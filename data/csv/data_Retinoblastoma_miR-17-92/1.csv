0,[Value of serum miR-17-92 cluster in diagnosis of retinoblastoma].,"Objective: To investigate the value of serum miR-17-92 cluster in the diagnosis of retinoblastoma (RB). Methods: Serum samples were collected from 20 children with RB and 20 healthy controls. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the expression of miR-17-92 cluster. The expression of miR-17-92 cluster was compared between children with different stages of RB and the changes in the expression of miR-17-92 cluster after multimodality therapy were analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to investigate the value of serum miR-17-92 cluster in the diagnosis of RB. Results: Compared with the healthy controls, the children with RB had significantly higher relative expression of miR-17-3P, miR-17-5P, miR-18a, and miR-20a in serum (P<0.05), and miR-18a showed the greatest increase. There were no significant differences in the relative expression of miR-19a, miR-19b-1, and miR-92a-1 between children with RB and healthy controls (P>0.05). There were no significant differences in the expression of miR-17-5P, miR-17-3P, miR-18a, and miR-20a between the children with early-to-moderate stage of RB and those with advanced stage of RB (P>0.05), but there were significant reductions after multimodality therapy (P<0.05). In the diagnosis of RB, the areas under the ROC curve (AUCs) for serum miR-17-3P, miR-17-5P, miR-18a, and miR-20a were 0.770, 0.755, 0.828, and 0.665 respectively, and miR-18a had the largest AUC, with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 65%. Conclusions: miR-17-3P, miR-17-5P, miR-18a, and miR-20a are highly expressed in the serum of children with RB, and miR-18a may be used as a new marker for the diagnosis of RB.",Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics
1,Long non-coding RNA H19 suppresses retinoblastoma progression via counteracting miR-17-92 cluster.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are frequently dysregulated and play important roles in many cancers. lncRNA H19 is one of the earliest discovered lncRNAs which has diverse roles in different cancers. However, the expression, roles, and action mechanisms of H19 in retinoblastoma are still largely unknown. In this study, we found that H19 is downregulated in retinoblastoma tissues and cell lines. Gain-of-function and loss-of-function assays showed that H19 inhibits retinoblastoma cell proliferation, induces retinoblastoma cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, we identified seven miR-17-92 cluster binding sites on H19, and found that H19 directly bound to miR-17-92 cluster via these seven binding sites. Through binding to miR-17-92 cluster, H19 relieves the suppressing roles of miR-17-92 cluster on p21. Furthermore, H19 represses STAT3 activation induced by miR-17-92 cluster. Hence, our results revealed that H19 upregulates p21 expression, inhibits STAT3 phosphorylation, and downregulates the expression of STAT3 target genes BCL2, BCL2L1, and BIRC5. In addition, functional assays demonstrated that the mutation of miR-17-92 cluster binding sites on H19 abolished the proliferation inhibiting, cell cycle arrest and cell apoptosis inducing roles of H19 in retinoblastoma. In conclusion, our data suggested that H19 inhibits retinoblastoma progression via counteracting the roles of miR-17-92 cluster, and implied that enhancing the action of H19 may be a promising therapeutic strategy for retinoblastoma.",Journal of cellular biochemistry
2,The SOX4/miR-17-92/RB1 Axis Promotes Prostate Cancer Progression.,"Although androgen-deprivation treatment (ADT) is the main treatment for advanced prostate cancer (PCa), it eventually fails. This failure invariably leads to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and the development of the neuroendocrine (NE) phenotype. The molecular basis for PCa progression remains unclear. Previously, we and others have demonstrated that the sex-determining region Y-box 4 (SOX4) gene, a critical developmental transcription factor, is overexpressed and associated with poor prognosis in PCa patients. In this study, we show that SOX4 expression is associated with PCa progression and the development of the NE phenotype in androgen deprivation conditions. High-throughput microRNA profiling and bioinformatics analyses suggest that SOX4 may target the miR-17-92 cluster. SOX4 transcriptionally upregulates miR-17-92 cluster expression in PCa cells. SOX4-induced PCa cell proliferation, migration, and invasion are also mediated by miR-17-92 cluster members. Furthermore, RB1 is a target gene of miR-17-92 cluster. We found that SOX4 downregulates RB1 protein expression by upregulating the miR-17-92 expression. In addition, SOX4-knockdown restrains NE phenotype and PCa cell proliferation. Clinically, the overexpression of miR-17-92 members is shown to be positively correlated with SOX4 expression in PCa patients, whereas RB1 expression is negatively correlated with SOX4 expression in patients with the aggressive PCa phenotype. Collectively, we propose a novel model of a SOX4/miR-17-92/RB1 axis that may exist to promote PCa progression.","Neoplasia (New York, N.Y.)"
3,The role of miR-17-92 cluster in the expression of tumor suppressor genes in unrestricted somatic stem cells.,"The miR-17-92 cluster consisted of seven miRNAs (mir-17-5p, -17-3p, -18a, -19a, -20a, -19b-1, and -92a-1). Previous studies have shown this cluster has been over-expressed in several cancers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the over-expression impacts of miR-17-92 on stem cells. In the current work, the effect of miR-17-92 cluster which was cloned in Lentiviral vector has been investigated on unrestricted somatic stem cells (USSCs). Tumor suppressor genes (p53, p15, RBL1, SMAD2, SMAD4, and MAPK-1) expression, especially p53, was considerably reduced. These data show the potential of miR-17-92 for oncogenesis regulation in stem cells. In conclusion, the role of miR-17-92 in USSCs may provide a better understanding of its function in tumorigenesis and for the possible use in cell therapy of the anti-mir-17-92 cluster.",Biologicals : journal of the International Association of Biological Standardization
4,"The role, mechanism and potentially novel biomarker of microRNA-17-92 cluster in macrosomia.","Macrosomia is one of the most common perinatal complications of pregnancy and has life-long health implications for the infant. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been identified to regulate placental development, yet the role of miRNAs in macrosomia remains poorly understood. Here we investigated the role of miR-17-92 cluster in macrosomia. The expression levels of five miRNAs in miR-17-92 cluster were significantly elevated in placentas of macrosomia, which may due to the up-regulation of miRNA-processing enzyme Drosha and Dicer. Cell cycle pathway was identified to be the most relevant pathways regulated by miR-17-92 cluster miRNAs. Importantly, miR-17-92 cluster increased proliferation, attenuated cell apoptosis and accelerated cells entering S phase by targeting SMAD4 and RB1 in HTR8/SVneo cells. Furthermore, we found that expression of miR-17-92 cluster in serum had a high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for macrosomia (AUC: 80.53%; sensitivity: 82.61%; specificity: 69.57%). Our results suggested that miR-17-92 cluster contribute to macrosomia development by targeting regulators of cell cycle pathway. Our findings not only provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms of macrosomia, but also the clinical value of miR-17-92 cluster as a predictive biomarker for macrosomia.",Scientific reports
5,miR-17~92 cooperates with RB pathway mutations to promote retinoblastoma.,"The miR-17~92 cluster is a potent microRNA-encoding oncogene. Here, we show that miR-17~92 synergizes with loss of Rb family members to promote retinoblastoma. We observed miR-17~92 genomic amplifications in murine retinoblastoma and high expression of miR-17~92 in human retinoblastoma. While miR-17~92 was dispensable for mouse retinal development, miR-17~92 overexpression, together with deletion of Rb and p107, led to rapid emergence of retinoblastoma with frequent metastasis to the brain. miR-17~92 oncogenic function in retinoblastoma was not mediated by a miR-19/PTEN axis toward apoptosis suppression, as found in lymphoma/leukemia models. Instead, miR-17~92 increased the proliferative capacity of Rb/p107-deficient retinal cells. We found that deletion of Rb family members led to compensatory up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. miR-17~92 overexpression counteracted p21Cip1 up-regulation, promoted proliferation, and drove retinoblastoma formation. These results demonstrate that the oncogenic determinants of miR-17~92 are context-specific and provide new insights into miR-17~92 function as an RB-collaborating gene in cancer.",Genes & development
6,Counterbalance between RB inactivation and miR-17-92 overexpression in reactive oxygen species and DNA damage induction in lung cancers.,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive disease that exhibits rapid growth and genetic instability. We found earlier frequent overexpression of the miR-17-92 microRNA cluster, and showed that SCLC cells were addicted to continued expressions of miR-17-5p and miR-20a, major components of this microRNA cluster. In this study, we identified the frequent presence of constitutively phosphorylated H2AX (gamma-H2AX), which reflects continuing DNA damage, preferentially in SCLC. Knockdown of RB induced gamma-H2AX foci formation in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with wild-type RB, in association with growth inhibition and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which was canceled by overexpression of miR-17-92. Conversely, induction of gamma-H2AX was observed in a miR-17-92-overexpressing SCLC cell line with miR-20a antisense oligonucleotides. These findings suggest that miR-17-92 overexpression may serve as a fine-tuning influence to counterbalance the generation of DNA damage in RB-inactivated SCLC cells, thus reducing excessive DNA damage to a tolerable level and consequently leading to genetic instability. Therefore, miR-17-92 may be an excellent therapeutic target candidate to elicit excessive DNA damage in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics.",Oncogene
7,Oncogenic microRNA 17-92 cluster is regulated by epithelial cell adhesion molecule and could be a potential therapeutic target in retinoblastoma.,"Purpose: Several miRNAs have been reported as candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressors, which are involved in the pathways specifically altered during tumorigenesis or metastasis. The miR 17-92 cluster located in 13q31 locus might contribute to retinoblastoma (RB) oncogenesis as 13q31 is amplified often in RB. We attempted to identify the factors involved in the regulation of miR 17-92 cluster in RB. Methods: Real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR was performed to study the expression of the miR 17-92 cluster in primary RB tumors and in Y79 cells after epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) silencing. EpCAM was silenced using siRNA and confirmed by western blotting. The Y79 cells were transfected with individual and mixed antagomirs and studied the cell viability by (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, invasion by matrigel analysis and caspase-3 expression by flow cytometry. Results: The relative expression of miR 17-92 cluster, compared to that of a normal retina, ranged from 25 to 220 fold (p<0.0001), miR-18 being highly expressed in RB. Post EpCAM silencing resulted in a significant decrease (p<0.01) in the expression of the miR 17-92 cluster by 4 to eightfold in Y79 cells. Y79 cells transfected with an antagomirs mix (all 5 miRNAs) showed decreased cell viability (p<0.001) and cell invasion (p<0.001). Similarly, Y79 cells treated with antagomirs mix showed increased expression of caspase-3 (p<0.001), which confirms the anti-proliferative effect of antagomirs. Conclusions: This study has showed varied expression of the miR17-92 cluster in primary RB tumors. EpCAM influences miR 17-92 cluster expression in retinoblastoma. In addition, we showed that the miR 17-92 cluster plays a role in RB cell proliferation and invasion. Therefore, targeting the miRNA 17-92 cluster may be beneficial for controlling Y79/RB cell proliferation and invasion.",Molecular vision
8,"Synthetic lethality between Rb, p53 and Dicer or miR-17-92 in retinal progenitors suppresses retinoblastoma formation.","Synthetic lethality is a promising strategy for specific targeting of cancer cells that carry mutations that are absent in normal cells. This approach may help overcome the challenge associated with targeting dysfunctional tumour suppressors, such as p53 and Rb (refs 1, 2). Here we show that Dicer1 targeting prevents retinoblastoma formation in mice by synthetic lethality with combined inactivation of p53 and Rb. Although Dicer1 functions as a haploinsufficient tumour suppressor, its complete loss of function is selected against during tumorigenesis(3-5). We show that Dicer1 deficiency is tolerated in Rb-deficient retinal progenitor cells harbouring an intact p53 pathway, but not in the absence of p53. This synthetic lethality is mediated by the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster because its deletion phenocopies Dicer1 loss in this context. miR-17-92 inactivation suppresses retinoblastoma formation in mice and co-silencing of miR-17/20a and p53 cooperatively decreases the viability of human retinoblastoma cells. These data provide an explanation for the selective pressure against loss of Dicer1 during tumorigenesis and a proof-of-concept that targeting miRNAs may potentially represent a general approach for synthetic lethal targeting of cancer cells that harbour specific cancer-inducing genotypes.",Nature cell biology
9,"miR-20a and miR-290, multi-faceted players with a role in tumourigenesis and senescence.","Expression of microRNAs changes markedly in tumours and evidence indicates that they are causatively related to tumourigenesis, behaving as tumour suppressor microRNAs or onco microRNAs; in some cases they can behave as both depending on the type of cancer. Some tumour suppressor microRNAs appear to be an integral part of the p53 and Retinoblastoma (RB) network, the main regulatory pathways controlling senescence, a major tumour suppressor mechanism. The INK4a/ARF locus which codifies for two proteins, p19ARF and p16INK4a, plays a central role in senescence by controlling both p53 and RB. Recent evidence shows that the proto-oncogene leukaemia/lymphoma related factor, a p19ARF specific repressor, is controlled by miRNAs and that miRNAs, in particular miR-20a and miR-290, are causatively involved in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF) senescence in culture. Intriguingly, both miR-20a, member of the oncogenic miR-17-92 cluster, and miR-290, belonging to the miR-290-295 cluster, are highly expressed in embryonic stem (ES) cells. The pro-senescence role of miR-20a and miR-290 in MEF is apparently in contrast with their proliferative role in tumour and ES cells. We propose that miRNAs may exert opposing functions depending on the miRNAs repertoire as well as target/s level/s present in different cellular contexts, suggesting the importance of evaluating miRNAs activity in diverse genetic settings before their therapeutic use as tumour suppressors.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine

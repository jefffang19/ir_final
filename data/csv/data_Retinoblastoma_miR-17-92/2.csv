0,STAT3 inhibition suppresses proliferation of retinoblastoma through down-regulation of positive feedback loop of STAT3/miR-17-92 clusters.,"Retinoblastoma, the most common intraocular malignant tumor in children, is characterized by the loss of both functional alleles of RB1 gene, which however alone cannot maintain malignant characteristics of retinoblastoma cells. Nevertheless, the investigation of other molecular aberrations such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and miRNAs is still lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that STAT3 is activated in retinoblastoma cells, Ki67-positive areas of in vivo orthotopic tumors in BALB/c nude mice, and human retinoblastoma tissues of the advanced stage. Furthermore, target genes of STAT3 including BCL2, BCL2L1, BIRC5, and MMP9 are up-regulated in retinoblastoma cells compared to other retinal constituent cells. Interestingly, STAT3 inhibition by targeted siRNA suppresses the proliferation of retinoblastoma cells and the formation of in vivo orthotopic tumors. In line with these results, STAT3 siRNA effectively induces down-regulation of target genes of STAT3. In addition, miRNA microarray analysis and further real-time PCR experiments with STAT3 siRNA treatment show that STAT3 activation is related to the up-regulation of miR-17-92 clusters in retinoblastoma cells via positive feedback loop between them. In conclusion, we suggest that STAT3 inhibition could be a potential therapeutic approach in retinoblastoma through the suppression of tumor proliferation.",Oncotarget
1,MiR-17-5p enhances pancreatic cancer proliferation by altering cell cycle profiles via disruption of RBL2/E2F4-repressing complexes.,"The members of the miR-17-92 cluster are upregulated in various cancers and function as a cluster of oncogenic miRNA. Our study characterized a new function of miR-17-5p, a member of the miR-17-92 cluster, in regulating cell proliferation in pancreatic cancer. Our results indicate that miR-17-5p was up-regulated in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and directly targeted the retinoblastoma-like protein 2 (RBL2), a tumor suppressor belonging to the Rb family. High levels of miR-17-5p and low levels of RBL2 were associated with poor prognosis. RBL2 interacted with the transcription factor E2F4 and bound to the promoter regions of the E2F target genes. Disruption of the RBL2/E2F4 complex by miR-17-5p overexpression shifted the activity of E2F from gene repressing to gene activating, which induced cell cycle entry and proliferation. These results suggest that miR-17-5p promoted proliferation in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma cells (PDAC), and altered cell cycle profiles in vivo and in vitro, by disrupting the RBL2/E2F4-associated gene repressing complexes via direct targeting of RBL2. The new regulatory network, involving miR-17-5p and RBL2, emerges as a new target of PDAC treatment.",Cancer letters
2,Oncogenic role of miR-17-92 cluster in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells.,"Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs and constitute a novel class of negative gene regulators that are found in both plants and animals. Several miRNAs play crucial roles in cancer cell growth. To identify miRNAs specifically deregulated in anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) cells, we performed a comprehensive analysis of miRNA expressions in ARO cells and primary thyrocytes using miRNA microarrays. MiRNAs in a miR-17-92 cluster were overexpressed in ARO cells. We confirmed the overexpression of those miRNAs by Northern blot analysis in ARO and FRO cells. In 3 of 6 clinical ATC samples, miR-17-3p and miR-17-5p were robustly overexpressed in cancer lesions compared to adjacent normal tissue. To investigate the functional role of these miRNAs in ATC cells, ARO and FRO cells were transfected with miRNA inhibitors, antisense oligonucleotides containing locked nucleic acids. Suppression of miR-17-3p caused complete growth arrest, presumably due to caspase activation resulting in apoptosis. MiR-17-5p or miR-19a inhibitor also induced strong growth reduction, but only miR-17-5p inhibitor led to cellular senescence. On the other hand, miR-18a inhibitor only moderately attenuated the cell growth. Thus, we have clarified functional differences among the members of the cluster in ATC cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that the miR-17-92 cluster plays an important role in certain types of ATCs and could be a novel target for ATC treatment.",Cancer science
3,miR-17-92 cluster accelerates adipocyte differentiation by negatively regulating tumor-suppressor Rb2/p130.,"Adipogenesis involves cell proliferation and differentiation, both of which have been shown to be regulated by micro (mi)RNA. During mouse preadipocyte 3T3L1 cell differentiation, we found that miR-17-92, a miRNA cluster that promotes cell proliferation in various cancers, was significantly up-regulated at the clonal expansion stage of adipocyte differentiation. Stable transfection of 3T3L1 cells with miR-17-92 resulted in accelerated differentiation and increased triglyceride accumulation after hormonal stimulation. By using a luciferase reporter assay, we demonstrated that miR-17-92 directly targeted the 3' UTR region of Rb2/p130, accounting for subsequently reduced Rb2/p130 mRNA and protein quantities at the stage of clonal expansion. siRNA-mediated knock-down of Rb2/p130 at the same stage of clonal expansion recapitulated the phenotype of overexpression of miR-17-92 in the stably transfected 3T3L1 cells. These data indicate that miR-17-92 promotes adipocyte differentiation by targeting and negatively regulating Rb2/p130.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
4,A mouse model of MYCN-driven retinoblastoma reveals MYCN-independent tumor reemergence.,"The most frequent focal alterations in human retinoblastoma are mutations in the tumor-suppressor gene retinoblastoma (RB) and amplification of the oncogene MYCN. Whether MYCN overexpression drives retinoblastoma has not been assessed in model systems. Here, we have shown that Rb inactivation collaborates strongly with MYCN overexpression and leads to retinoblastoma in mice. Overexpression of human MYCN in the context of Rb inactivation increased the expression of MYC-, E2F-, and ribosome-related gene sets, promoted excessive proliferation, and led to retinoblastoma with anaplastic changes. We then modeled responses to MYCN-directed therapy by suppressing MYCN expression in MYCN-driven retinoblastomas. Initially, MYCN suppression led to proliferation arrest and partial tumor regression with loss of anaplasia. However, over time, retinoblastomas reemerged, typically without reactivation of human MYCN or amplification of murine Mycn. A subset of returning retinoblastomas showed genomic amplification of a Mycn target gene encoding the miR cluster miR-17~92, while most retinoblastomas reemerged without clear genetic alterations in either Mycn or known Mycn targets. This Rb/MYCN model recapitulates key genetic driver alterations seen in human retinoblastoma and reveals the emergence of MYCN independence in an initially MYCN-driven tumor.",The Journal of clinical investigation
5,The HMG box transcription factor HBP1: a cell cycle inhibitor at the crossroads of cancer signaling pathways.,"HMG box protein 1 (HBP1) is a transcription factor and a potent cell cycle inhibitor in normal and cancer cells. HBP1 activates or represses the expression of different cell cycle genes (such as CDKN2A, CDKN1A, and CCND1) through direct DNA binding, cofactor recruitment, chromatin remodeling, or neutralization of other transcription factors. Among these are LEF1, TCF4, and MYC in the WNT/beta-catenin pathway. HBP1 also contributes to oncogenic RAS-induced senescence and terminal cell differentiation. Collectively, these activities suggest a tumor suppressor function. However, HBP1 is not listed among frequently mutated cancer driver genes. Nevertheless, HBP1 expression is lower in several tumor types relative to matched normal tissues. Several micro-RNAs, such as miR-155, miR-17-92, and miR-29a, dampen HBP1 expression in cancer cells of various origins. The phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway also inhibits HBP1 transcription by preventing FOXO binding to the HBP1 promoter. In addition, AKT directly phosphorylates HBP1, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional activity. Taken together, these findings place HBP1 at the center of a network of micro-RNAs and oncoproteins that control cell proliferation. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of HBP1 function in human physiology and diseases.",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS
6,Deregulation of hsa-miR-20b expression in TNF-alpha-induced premature senescence of human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells.,"miRNAs are important regulators of cellular senescence yet the extent of their involvement remains to be investigated. We sought to identify miRNAs that are involved in cytokine-induced premature senescence (CIPS) in endothelial cells. CIPS was established in young human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HMVEC-Ls) following treatment with a sublethal dose (20ng/ml) of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) for 15days. In parallel, HMVEC-Ls were grown and routinely passaged until the onset of replicative senescence (RS). Differential expression analysis following miRNA microarray profiling revealed an overlapped of eight deregulated miRNAs in both the miRNA profiles of RS and TNF-α-induced premature senescence cells. Amongst the deregulated miRNAs were members of the miR 17-92 cluster which are known regulators of angiogenesis. The role of hsa-miR-20b in TNF-α-induced premature senescence, a paralog member of the miR 17-92 cluster, was further investigated. Biotin-labeled hsa-miR-20b captured the enriched transcripts of retinoblastoma-like 1 (RBL1), indicating that RBL1 is a target of hsa-miR-20b. Knockdown of hsa-miR-20b attenuated premature senescence in the TNF-α-treated HMVEC-Ls as evidenced by increased cell proliferation, increased RBL1 mRNA expression level but decreased protein expression of p16INK4a, a cellular senescence marker. These findings provide an early insight into the role of hsa-miR-20b in endothelial senescence.",Microvascular research
7,miR than meets the eye.,"Retinoblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer that has served as a paradigm to investigate the mechanisms of tumorigenesis. In this issue of Genes & Development, Conkrite and colleagues (pp. 1734-1745) found high levels of the miR-17~92 and miR-106b-25 microRNAs in primary retinoblastomas and show that overexpression of miR-17~92 accelerates retinoblastoma development in mice by promoting proliferation, in part by reducing expression of the cell cycle inhibitor p21. These experiments identify the RB/miR-17~92/p21 axis as a critical regulator of retinoblastoma tumorigenesis and potentially many other cancers.",Genes & development
8,"Evaluation of SD-208, a TGF-beta-RI Kinase Inhibitor, as an Anticancer Agent in Retinoblastoma.","Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular tumor in children resulting from genetic alterations and transformation of mature retinal cells. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of SD-208, TGF-β-RI kinase inhibitor, on the expression of some miRNAs including a miR-17/92 cluster in retinoblastoma cells. Prior to initiate this work, the cell proliferation was studied by Methyl Thiazolyl Tetrazolium (MTT) and bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assays. Then, the expression patterns of four miRNAs (18a, 20a, 22, and 34a) were investigated in the treated SD-208 (0.0, 1, 2 and 3 µM) and untreated Y-79 cells. A remarkable inhibition of the cell proliferation was found in Y-79 cells treated with SD-208 versus untreated cells. Also, the expression changes were observed in miRNAs 18a, 20a, 22 and 34a in response to SD-208 treatment (P<0.05). The findings of the present study suggest that the anti-cancer effect of SD-208 may be exerted due to the regulation of specific miRNAs, at least in this particular retinoblastoma cell line. To the best of the researchers' knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that the SD-208 could alter the expression of tumor suppressive miRNAs as well as oncomiRs in vitro. In conclusion, the present data suggest that SD-208 could be an alternative agent in retinoblastoma treatment.",Acta medica Iranica
9,An E2F/miR-20a autoregulatory feedback loop.,"The E2F family of transcription factors is essential in the regulation of the cell cycle and apoptosis. While the activity of E2F1-3 is tightly controlled by the retinoblastoma family of proteins, the expression of these factors is also regulated at the level of transcription, post-translational modifications and protein stability. Recently, a new level of regulation of E2Fs has been identified, where micro-RNAs (miRNAs) from the mir-17-92 cluster influence the translation of the E2F1 mRNA. We now report that miR-20a, a member of the mir-17-92 cluster, modulates the translation of the E2F2 and E2F3 mRNAs via binding sites in their 3'-untranslated region. We also found that the endogenous E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3 directly bind the promoter of the mir-17-92 cluster activating its transcription, suggesting an autoregulatory feedback loop between E2F factors and miRNAs from the mir-17-92 cluster. Our data also point toward an anti-apoptotic role for miR-20a, since overexpression of this miRNA decreased apoptosis in a prostate cancer cell line, while inhibition of miR-20a by an antisense oligonucleotide resulted in increased cell death after doxorubicin treatment. This anti-apoptotic role of miR-20a may explain some of the oncogenic capacities of the mir-17-92 cluster. Altogether, these results suggest that the autoregulation between E2F1-3 and miR-20a is important for preventing an abnormal accumulation of E2F1-3 and may play a role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and apoptosis.",The Journal of biological chemistry

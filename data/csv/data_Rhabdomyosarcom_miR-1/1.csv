0,ZNF281/Zfp281 is a target of miR-1 and counteracts muscle differentiation.,"Defects in achieving a fully differentiated state and aberrant expression of genes and microRNAs (miRs) involved in differentiation are common to virtually all tumor types. Here, we demonstrate that the zinc finger transcription factor ZNF281/Zfp281 is down-regulated during epithelial, muscle, and granulocytic differentiation in vitro. The expression of this gene is absent in terminally differentiated human tissues, in contrast to the elevated expression in proliferating/differentiating ones. Analysis of the 3'UTR of ZNF281/Zfp281 revealed the presence of numerous previously undescribed miR binding sites that were proved to be functional for miR-mediated post-transcriptional regulation. Many of these miRs are involved in differentiation pathways of distinct cell lineages. Of interest, ZNF281/Zfp281 is able to inhibit muscle differentiation promoted by miR-1, of which ZNF281/Zfp281 is a direct target. These data suggest that down-regulation of ZNF281/Zfp281 during differentiation in various cell types may occur through specific miRs whose expression is tissue-restricted. In addition, we found that in rhabdomyosarcoma and leiomyosarcoma tumors, the expression of ZNF281/Zfp281 is significantly higher compared with normal counterparts. We extended our analysis to other human soft tissue sarcomas, in which the expression of ZNF281 is associated with a worse prognosis. In summary, we highlight here a new role of ZNF281/Zfp281 in counteracting muscle differentiation; its down-regulation is at least in part mediated by miR-1. The elevated expression of ZNF281/Zfp281 in soft tissue sarcomas warrants further analysis for its possible exploitation as a prognostic marker in this class of tumors.",Molecular oncology
1,Distinct roles for miR-1 and miR-133a in the proliferation and differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma cells.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in the pediatric population. As this tumor has an undifferentiated myogenic phenotype, agents that promote differentiation hold particular promise as part of a novel therapeutic approach to combat this type of cancer. In this report, we focus on the contribution of two microRNAs (miRNAs) in rhabdomyosarcomas. Levels of miR-1 and miR-133a are drastically reduced in representative cell lines from each major rhabdomyosarcoma subtype (embryonal and alveolar). Introduction of miR-1 and miR-133a into an embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma-derived cell line is cytostatic, thereby suggesting a tumor suppressor-like role for these myogenic miRNAs. Transcriptional profiling of cells after miR-1 and miR-133a expression reveals that miR-1 (but not miR-133a) exerts a strong promyogenic influence on these poorly differentiated tumor cells. We identify mRNAs that are down-regulated by these miRNAs and propose roles for miR-1 and miR-133a in repressing isoforms of genes that are normally not expressed in muscle. Finally, we show that mRNA targets of miR-1 and miR-133a are up-regulated in rhabdomyosarcomas, suggesting a causative role for these miRNAs in the development of rhabdomyosarcomas. More important, these results point to the promise of enhancing rhabdomyosarcoma therapy using miRNAs as agents that mediate cytostasis and promote muscle differentiation.",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology
2,"Downregulation of microRNAs miR-1, -206 and -29 stabilizes PAX3 and CCND2 expression in rhabdomyosarcoma.","Elevated levels of PAX3 and cell proliferation genes are characteristic features of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). We hypothesize that the increased levels of these genes are stabilized due to downregulation of specific miRNAs. In this study, we show that downregulation of miR-1, -206 and -29 stabilizes the expression of PAX3 and CCND2 in both embryonal (ERMS) and alveolar (ARMS) RMS types. Ectopic expression of miR-1 and 206 in JR1, an ERMS cell line, show significant downregulation of PAX3 protein expression, whereas overexpression of these miRNAs in Rh30, an ARMS cell line, did not show any effect in PAX3 protein levels. In ARMS, PAX3 forms a fusion transcript with FOXO1 and the resultant loss of PAX3 3'UTR in the fusion transcript indicate an oncogenic mechanism to evade miRNA-mediated regulation of PAX3. Further, we show that miR-1, -206 and -29 can regulate the expression of CCND2, a cell cycle gene. In addition to CCND2, miR-29 also targets E2F7, another cell cycle regulator. Cell function analysis shows that overexpression of miR-29 downregulates the expression of these cell cycle genes, induces partial G1 arrest leading to decreased cell proliferation. Taken together our data suggest that the RMS state is stabilized by the deregulation of multiple miRNAs and their target genes, supporting a tumor suppressor role for these miRNA.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology
3,MicroRNAs and epigenetic mechanisms of rhabdomyosarcoma development.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma in children. Two main subtypes of rhabdomyosarcoma with different molecular pattern and distinct clinical behaviour may be identified - embryonal and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. All types of rhabdomyosarcoma are believed to be of myogenic origin as they express high levels of myogenesis-related factors. They all, however, fail to undergo a terminal differentiation which results in tumour formation. In the aberrant regulation of myogenesis in rhabdomyosarcoma, microRNAs and epigenetic factors are particularly involved. Indeed, these mediators seem to be even more significant for the development of rhabdomyosarcoma than canonical myogenic transcription factors like MyoD, a master regulatory switch for myogenesis. Therefore, in this review we focus on the regulation of rhabdomyosarcoma progression by microRNAs, and especially on microRNAs of the myo-miRNAs family (miR-1, -133a/b and -206), other well-known myogenic regulators like miR-29, and on microRNAs recently recognized to play a role in the differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma, such as miR-450b-5p or miR-203. We also review changes in epigenetic modifiers associated with rhabdomyosarcoma, namely histone deacetylases and methyltransferases, especially from the Polycomp Group, like Yin Yang1 and Enhancer of Zeste Homolog2. Finally, we summarize how the functioning of these molecules can be affected by oxidative stress and how antioxidative enzymes can influence the development of this tumour.

4,MicroRNA-1/206 targets c-Met and inhibits rhabdomyosarcoma development.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous short (approximately 22) nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene function by modification of target mRNAs. miRNA-1 (miR-1) and miRNA-206 (miR-206) are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Due to the tissue-specific nature of miR-1/206 for skeletal muscles, we investigated the role of miR-1/206 in the development of rhabdomyosarcoma. Initially, we demonstrated that miR-1/206 expression was suppressed in rhabdomyosarcomas and found at very low levels in a rhabdomyosarcoma RD cell line. Transient transfection of miR-1/206 into cultured RD cells led to a significant decrease in cell growth and migration. Using bioinformatics, we identified two putative miR-1/206 binding sites within the 3'-untranslated region of the human c-Met mRNA. miR-1/206 was then shown to have activity on mRNA expression by targeting the c-Met 3'-untranslated region. The expression of c-Met protein was shown to be down-regulated by subsequent Western blot analysis. Conversely, up-regulation of c-Met was confirmed in tissue samples of human rhabdomyosarcoma, with its level inversely correlated with miR-1/206 expression. In vivo, miR-1/206-expressing tumor cells showed growth delay in comparison with negative control. Our results demonstrated that miR-1/206 suppressed c-Met expression in rhabdomyosarcoma and could function as a potent tumor suppressor in c-Met-overexpressing tumors. Inhibition of miR-1/206 function could contribute to aberrant cell proliferation and migration, leading to rhabdomyosarcoma development.",The Journal of biological chemistry
5,Cancer-Specific Energy Metabolism in Rhabdomyosarcoma Cells Is Regulated by MicroRNA.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a soft tissue sarcoma and is most frequently found in children. In RMS, there are two major subtypes, that is, embryonal RMS and alveolar RMS (ARMS). ARMS has exclusively the worse prognosis and is caused by formation of the chimeric PAX3-FOXO1 gene. Regarding cancer, the Warburg effect is known as a feature of cancer-specific metabolism. Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1), a splicer of pyruvate kinase muscle (PKM) mRNA, is a positive regulator of cancer-specific energy metabolism. We investigated the expression and effects of muscle-specific miR-1 and miR-133b on RMS cells (RD, KYM-1, Rh30, and Rh41) from the view of energy metabolism and regulation of the chimeric gene. As a result, downregulated miR-1 and miR-133b/upregulated PTBP1 were found in RMS cell lines as well as in RMS clinical cases. Ectopic expression of either miR in both types of RMS cells induced autophagic cell death through silencing of PTBP1. Interestingly, we validated that miR-133b also knock downed PAX3-FOXO1. Moreover, we found that PAX3-FOXO1 positively regulated the PKM2-dominant expression through enhanced expression of PTBP1. These findings suggest that the miR-1 and miR-133b/PTBP1 axis and miR-133b/PAX3-FOXO1/PTBP1 axis contributed to the maintenance of cancer-specific energy metabolism.",Nucleic acid therapeutics
6,The muscle-specific microRNA miR-206 blocks human rhabdomyosarcoma growth in xenotransplanted mice by promoting myogenic differentiation.,"Many microRNAs (miRNAs), posttranscriptional regulators of numerous cellular processes and developmental events, are downregulated in tumors. However, their role in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. In this work, we examined the role of the muscle-specific miRNAs miR-1 and miR-206 in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a soft tissue sarcoma thought to arise from skeletal muscle progenitors. We have shown that miR-1 was barely detectable in primary RMS of both the embryonal and alveolar subtypes and that both miR-1 and miR-206 failed to be induced in RMS cell lines upon serum deprivation. Moreover, reexpression of miR-206 in RMS cells promoted myogenic differentiation and blocked tumor growth in xenografted mice by switching the global mRNA expression profile to one that resembled mature muscle. Finally, we showed that the product of the MET proto-oncogene, the Met tyrosine-kinase receptor, which is overexpressed in RMS and has been implicated in RMS pathogenesis, was downregulated in murine satellite cells by miR-206 at the onset of normal myogenesis. Thus, failure of posttranscriptional modulation may underlie Met overexpression in RMS and other types of cancer. We propose that tissue-specific miRNAs such as miR-1 and miR-206, given their ability to modulate hundreds of transcripts and to act as nontoxic differentiating agents, may override the genomic heterogeneity of solid tumors and ultimately hold greater therapeutic potential than single gene-directed drugs.",The Journal of clinical investigation
7,A selective screening platform reveals unique global expression patterns of microRNAs in a cohort of human soft-tissue sarcomas.,"Sarcomas are malignant heterogenous tumors of mesenchymal derivation. Emerging data suggest that miRNA might have a causal role in sarcomagenesis. Herein, we used a selective miRNA screening platform to study the comparative global miRNA expression signatures in a cohort of human sarcomas with the caveat that comparisons between tumor and non-tumor cells were performed from the same patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Five histologic types were examined that included: myxoid liposarcoma, well-differentiated liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. In addition, soft-tissue lipomas and normal fat were included as a separate set of controls for the lipogenic tumors. Clustering analysis showed a distinct global difference in expression patterns between the normal and sarcoma tissues. Expression signatures in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed tight clustering in synovial and myxoid liposarcomas, and the least clustering was observed in the pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma subtype. MiR-145 showed underexpression in pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. Unexpectedly, we found that a set of muscle-specific microRNAs (miRNAs; myomiRs): miR-133, miR-1, and miR-206 was significantly underexpressed in well-differentiated liposarcoma and synovial sarcoma, suggesting that they may function as tumor suppressors as described in muscle-relevant rhabdomyosarcomas. In addition, a tight linear progression of miRNA expression was identified from normal fat to dedifferentiated liposarcoma. These results suggest that miRNA expression profiles could elucidate classes of miRNAs that may elicit tumor-relevant activities in specific sarcoma subtypes.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology
8,"Circulating muscle-specific microRNA, miR-206, as a potential diagnostic marker for rhabdomyosarcoma.","Presently there is no serum biomarker of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Several studies have shown that profiles of microRNA (miRNA) expression differ among tumor types. Here we evaluated the feasibility of using muscle-specific miRNAs (miR-1, -133a, -133b and -206) as biomarkers of RMS. Expression of muscle-specific miRNAs, especially miR-206, was significantly higher in RMS cell lines than in other tumor cell lines, as well as in RMS tumor specimens. Further, serum levels of muscle-specific miRNAs were significantly higher in patients with RMS tumors than in patients with non-RMS tumors. Normalized serum miR-206 expression level could be used to differentiate between RMS and non-RMS tumors, with sensitivity of 1.0 and specificity of 0.913. These results raise the possibility of using circulating muscle-specific miRNAs, especially miR-206, as landmark biomarkers for RMS.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications
9,Downregulation of microRNA-206 is a potent prognostic marker for patients with gastric cancer.,"Background: MicroRNA-206 (miR-206), as a homolog of miR-1, plays important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of various human malignancies, including breast cancer, endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioma, lung cancer, and laryngeal cancer. However, its involvement in gastric cancer has remained unclear. Aim: To examine the expression patterns and clinical implications of miR-206 in gastric cancer. Materials and methods: Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression levels of miR-206 in 98 pairs of gastric cancer and normal adjacent mucosa. In addition, the clinicopathologic significance and the prognostic value of miR-206 expression were further determined. Results: At first, miR-206 expression was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues when compared with normal adjacent mucosa (P<0.001). Next, tumors with low miR-206 expression had a greater extent of lymph node metastasis (P=0.01), presence of venous invasion (P=0.008), and hematogenous recurrence (P=0.01), and were at a worse stage (P=0.03) than the tumors with a high miR-206 expression. Then, the gastric cancer patients with a low miR-206 expression had shorter overall survival than those with a high miR-206 expression (P=0.02). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that miR-206 expression was an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that the downregulation of miR-206 was significantly correlated with tumor progression and may be a potent prognostic marker of gastric cancer. miR-206 might serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of this cancer.",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology

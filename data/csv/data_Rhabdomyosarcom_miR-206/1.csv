0,SMYD1 and G6PD modulation are critical events for miR-206-mediated differentiation of rhabdomyosarcoma.,"Rhadomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. RMS cells resemble fetal myoblasts but are unable to complete myogenic differentiation. In previous work we showed that miR-206, which is low in RMS, when induced in RMS cells promotes the resumption of differentiation by modulating more than 700 genes. To better define the pathways involved in the conversion of RMS cells into their differentiated counterpart, we focused on 2 miR-206 effectors emerged from the microarray analysis, SMYD1 and G6PD. SMYD1, one of the most highly upregulated genes, is a H3K4 histone methyltransferase. Here we show that SMYD1 silencing does not interfere with the proliferative block or with the loss anchorage independence imposed by miR-206, but severely impairs differentiation of ERMS, ARMS, and myogenic cells. Thus SMYD1 is essential for the activation of muscle genes. Conversely, among the downregulated genes, we found G6PD, the enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step of the pentose phosphate shunt. In this work, we confirmed that G6PD is a direct target of miR-206. Moreover, we showed that G6PD silencing in ERMS cells impairs proliferation and soft agar growth. However, G6PD overexpression does not interfere with the pro-differentiating effect of miR-206, suggesting that G6PD downmodulation contributes to - but is not an absolute requirement for - the tumor suppressive potential of miR-206. Targeting cancer metabolism may enhance differentiation. However, therapeutic inhibition of G6PD is encumbered by side effects. As an alternative, we used DCA in combination with miR-206 to increase the flux of pyruvate into the mitochondrion by reactivating PDH. DCA enhanced the inhibition of RMS cell growth induced by miR-206, and sustained it upon miR-206 de-induction. Altogether these results link miR-206 to epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, and suggest that it may be worth combining differentiation-inducing with metabolism-directed approaches.","Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)"
1,The oncomir face of microRNA-206: A permanent miR-206 transfection study.,"MiR-206 is a remarkable miRNA because it functions as a suppressor miRNA in rhabdomyosarcoma while at the same time, as previously showed, it can act as an oncomiRNA in SMARCB1 immunonegative soft tissue sarcomas. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of miR-206 on its several target genes in various human tumorous and normal cell lines. In the current work, we created miR-206-overexpressing cell lines (HT-1080, Caco2, iASC, and SS-iASC) using permanent transfection. mRNA expression of the target genes of miR-206 (SMARCB1, ACTL6A, CCND1, POLA1, NOTCH3, MET, and G6PD) and SMARCB1 protein expression were examined with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, immunocytochemistry, and flow cytometry. MiRNA inhibition was used to validate our results. We found a diverse silencing effect of miR-206 on its target genes. While an overall tendency of downregulation was noted, expression profiles of individual cell lines showed large variability. Only CCND1 and MET were consistently downregulated. MiR-206 had an antiproliferative effect on a normal human fibroblast cell line. A strong silencing effect of SMARCB1 in miR-206 transfected SS-iASC was most likely caused by the synergic influence of the SS18-SSX1 fusion protein and miR-206. In the same cell line, a moderate decrease of SMARCB1 protein expression could be observed with immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. In the most comprehensive analysis of miR-206 effects so far, a modest but significant downregulation of miR-206 targets on the mRNA level was confirmed across all cell lines. However, the variability of the effect shows that the action of this miRNA is largely cell context-dependent. Our results also support the conception that the oncomiR effect of miR-206 on SMARCB1 plays an important but not exclusive role in SMARCB1 immunonegative soft tissue sarcomas so it can be considered important in planning the targeted therapy of these tumors in the future. Impact statement Mir-206 is a very unique microRNA because it can act as a suppressor miRNA or as an oncomiRNA depending on the tumor tissue. In SMARCB1 negative soft tissue sarcomas miR-206 is overexpressed, so thus in epithelioid and synovial sarcomas it functions as an oncomiRNA. MiR-206 has diverse silencing effects on its target genes. We found that the action of miR-206 is largely cell context dependent. The oncomiR role of miR-206 is crucial but not exclusive in SMARCB1 negative soft tissue sarcomas and miR-206 has an antiproliferative effect on a normal human fibroblast cell line. Expressions of miR-206 targets observed in tumors can only be reproduced in the corresponding tumorous cell lines. This is the first study which examined the permanent effect of miR-206 on its target genes in normal, tumor, and genetically engineered cell lines.","Experimental biology and medicine (Maywood, N.J.)"
2,Heme Oxygenase-1 Controls an HDAC4-miR-206 Pathway of Oxidative Stress in Rhabdomyosarcoma.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is an aggressive soft tissue cancer characterized by disturbed myogenic differentiation. Here we report a role for the oxidative stress response factor HO-1 in progression of RMS. We found that HO-1 was elevated and its effector target miR-206 decreased in RMS cell lines and clinical primary tumors of the more aggressive alveolar phenotype (aRMS). In embryonal RMS (eRMS), HO-1 expression was induced by Pax3/7-FoxO1, an aRMS hallmark oncogene, followed by a drop in miR-206 levels. Inhibition of HO-1 by tin protoporphyrin (SnPP) or siRNA downregulated Pax3/7-FoxO1 target genes and induced a myogenic program in RMS. These effects were not mediated by altered myoD expression; instead, cells with elevated HO-1 produced less reactive oxygen species, resulting in nuclear localization of HDAC4 and miR-206 repression. HO-1 inhibition by SnPP reduced growth and vascularization of RMS tumors in vivo accompanied by induction of miR-206. Effects of SnPP on miR-206 expression and RMS tumor growth were mimicked by pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC. Thus, HO-1 inhibition activates an miR-206-dependent myogenic program in RMS, offering a novel therapeutic strategy for treatment of this malignancy. Cancer Res; 76(19); 5707-18.

3,PAX7 is a required target for microRNA-206-induced differentiation of fusion-negative rhabdomyosarcoma.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma of childhood. RMS can be parsed based on clinical outcome into two subtypes, fusion-positive RMS (FP-RMS) or fusion-negative RMS (FN-RMS) based on the presence or absence of either PAX3-FOXO1 or PAX7-FOXO1 gene fusions. In both RMS subtypes, tumor cells show histology and a gene expression pattern resembling that of developmentally arrested skeletal muscle. Differentiation therapy is an attractive approach to embryonal tumors of childhood including RMS; however, agents to drive RMS differentiation have not entered the clinic and their mechanisms remain unclear. MicroRNA-206 (miR-206) expression increases through normal muscle development and has decreased levels in RMS compared with normal skeletal muscle. Increasing miR-206 expression drives differentiation of RMS, but the target genes responsible for the relief of the development arrest are largely unknown. Using a combinatorial approach with gene and proteomic profiling coupled with genetic rescue, we identified key miR-206 targets responsible for the FN-RMS differentiation blockade, PAX7, PAX3, NOTCH3, and CCND2. Specifically, we determined that PAX7 downregulation is necessary for miR-206-induced cell cycle exit and myogenic differentiation in FN-RMS but not in FP-RMS. Gene knockdown of targets necessary for miR-206-induced differentiation alone or in combination was not sufficient to phenocopy the differentiation phenotype from miR-206, thus illustrating that miR-206 replacement offers the ability to modulate a complex network of genes responsible for the developmental arrest in FN-RMS. Genetic deletion of miR-206 in a mouse model of FN-RMS accelerated and exacerbated tumor development, indicating that both in vitro and in vivo miR-206 acts as a tumor suppressor in FN-RMS at least partially through downregulation of PAX7. Collectively, our results illustrate that miR-206 relieves the differentiation arrest in FN-RMS and suggests that miR-206 replacement could be a potential therapeutic differentiation strategy.",Cell death & disease
4,Circulating miR-26a as Potential Prognostic Biomarkers in Pediatric Rhabdomyosarcoma.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) arises from myogenic precursors that fail to complete muscle differentiation and represents the most frequent soft tissue sarcoma in children. Two major histological subtypes are recognized: alveolar RMS, characterized by a more aggressive behavior and a greater proneness to metastasis, and embryonal RMS which accounts for the 80% of cases and carries a better prognosis. Despite the survival of patients with localized tumors has progressively improved, RMS remains a challenging disease especially for metastatic patients and in case of progressive or recurrent disease after front-line therapy. MicroRNAs, a class of small non-coding RNA, have emerged as crucial players in cancer development and progression, and their detection in plasma (circulating miRNAs) represents a promising minimally invasive approach that deserve to be exploited in clinical practice. We evaluated the utility of circulating miRNAs as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in children with RMS profiling miRNAs from plasma of a small cohort of RMS patients and healthy donors (HD) using a qPCR Cancer Panel. An assessment of hemolysis status of plasma using miR-451/miR-23a ratio was performed as pre-analytical analysis. Statistical analysis revealed that miRNAs expression pattern clearly distinguished RMS patients from HD (p < 0.05). Interestingly, plasma levels of muscle-specific miR-206 were found to be significantly increased in RMS patients compared to HD, whereas levels of three potential tumor-suppressor miRNAs, miR-26a and miR-30b/30c, were found lower. Reduced levels of circulating miR-26a and miR-30b/c were further measured in an independent larger cohort of patients (validation set) by digital droplet PCR. In particular, we evidenced that miR-26a absolute plasma levels were associated with fusion status and adverse outcome (p < 0.05). Taken together, these findings demonstrate the potential of circulating miRNA as diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in children affected by this malignancy and enforced the key role of miR-26a in pediatric rhabdomyosarcoma.",Frontiers in genetics
5,MicroRNA-1/206 targets c-Met and inhibits rhabdomyosarcoma development.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous short (approximately 22) nucleotide RNAs that regulate gene function by modification of target mRNAs. miRNA-1 (miR-1) and miRNA-206 (miR-206) are highly expressed in skeletal muscle. Due to the tissue-specific nature of miR-1/206 for skeletal muscles, we investigated the role of miR-1/206 in the development of rhabdomyosarcoma. Initially, we demonstrated that miR-1/206 expression was suppressed in rhabdomyosarcomas and found at very low levels in a rhabdomyosarcoma RD cell line. Transient transfection of miR-1/206 into cultured RD cells led to a significant decrease in cell growth and migration. Using bioinformatics, we identified two putative miR-1/206 binding sites within the 3'-untranslated region of the human c-Met mRNA. miR-1/206 was then shown to have activity on mRNA expression by targeting the c-Met 3'-untranslated region. The expression of c-Met protein was shown to be down-regulated by subsequent Western blot analysis. Conversely, up-regulation of c-Met was confirmed in tissue samples of human rhabdomyosarcoma, with its level inversely correlated with miR-1/206 expression. In vivo, miR-1/206-expressing tumor cells showed growth delay in comparison with negative control. Our results demonstrated that miR-1/206 suppressed c-Met expression in rhabdomyosarcoma and could function as a potent tumor suppressor in c-Met-overexpressing tumors. Inhibition of miR-1/206 function could contribute to aberrant cell proliferation and migration, leading to rhabdomyosarcoma development.",The Journal of biological chemistry
6,miR-206 integrates multiple components of differentiation pathways to control the transition from growth to differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells.,"Background: Similar to replicating myoblasts, many rhabdomyosarcoma cells express the myogenic determination gene MyoD. In contrast to myoblasts, rhabdomyosarcoma cells do not make the transition from a regulative growth phase to terminal differentiation. Previously we demonstrated that the forced expression of MyoD with its E-protein dimerization partner was sufficient to induce differentiation and suppress multiple growth-promoting genes, suggesting that the dimer was targeting a switch that regulated the transition from growth to differentiation. Our data also suggested that a balance between various inhibitory transcription factors and MyoD activity kept rhabdomyosarcomas trapped in a proliferative state. Methods: Potential myogenic co-factors were tested for their ability to drive differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma cell culture models, and their relation to MyoD activity determined through molecular biological experiments. Results: Modulation of the transcription factors RUNX1 and ZNF238 can induce differentiation in rhabdomyosarcoma cells and their activity is integrated, at least in part, through the activation of miR-206, which acts as a genetic switch to transition the cell from a proliferative growth phase to differentiation. The inhibitory transcription factor MSC also plays a role in controlling miR-206, appearing to function by occluding a binding site for MyoD in the miR-206 promoter. Conclusions: These findings support a network model composed of coupled regulatory circuits with miR-206 functioning as a switch regulating the transition from one stable state (growth) to another (differentiation).",Skeletal muscle
7,The muscle-specific microRNA miR-206 blocks human rhabdomyosarcoma growth in xenotransplanted mice by promoting myogenic differentiation.,"Many microRNAs (miRNAs), posttranscriptional regulators of numerous cellular processes and developmental events, are downregulated in tumors. However, their role in tumorigenesis remains largely unknown. In this work, we examined the role of the muscle-specific miRNAs miR-1 and miR-206 in human rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), a soft tissue sarcoma thought to arise from skeletal muscle progenitors. We have shown that miR-1 was barely detectable in primary RMS of both the embryonal and alveolar subtypes and that both miR-1 and miR-206 failed to be induced in RMS cell lines upon serum deprivation. Moreover, reexpression of miR-206 in RMS cells promoted myogenic differentiation and blocked tumor growth in xenografted mice by switching the global mRNA expression profile to one that resembled mature muscle. Finally, we showed that the product of the MET proto-oncogene, the Met tyrosine-kinase receptor, which is overexpressed in RMS and has been implicated in RMS pathogenesis, was downregulated in murine satellite cells by miR-206 at the onset of normal myogenesis. Thus, failure of posttranscriptional modulation may underlie Met overexpression in RMS and other types of cancer. We propose that tissue-specific miRNAs such as miR-1 and miR-206, given their ability to modulate hundreds of transcripts and to act as nontoxic differentiating agents, may override the genomic heterogeneity of solid tumors and ultimately hold greater therapeutic potential than single gene-directed drugs.",The Journal of clinical investigation
8,Artesunate induces ROS- and p38 MAPK-mediated apoptosis and counteracts tumor growth in vivo in embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cells.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma represents about 50% of soft-tissue sarcomas and 10% of malignant solid tumors in childhood. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS) is the most frequent subtype, suggested to have an origin in muscle precursor cells that fail to exit the cell cycle and terminally differentiate mainly because of overexpression of the transcription factor, PAX7, which sustains proliferation, migration and invasiveness in ERMS cells. Artesunate (ARS) is a semi-synthetic derivative of artemisinin (ART), a natural compound well known as an antimalarial drug. However, ART and its derivatives have been found efficacious even as anticancer drugs that induce cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in several kinds of cancer. Here, we show that ARS dose-dependently induces DNA damage and apoptosis in ERMS cell lines. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and activation of p38 MAPK have a central role in triggering ARS-mediated apoptosis in ERMS cells; indeed either the antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine or the p38 MAPK inhibitor, SB203580, protects ERMS cells from ARS-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ARS treatment in ERMS cells ROS-dependently induces the expression of the myo-miRs, miR-133a and miR-206, which are down-regulated in RMS, and reduces PAX7 protein levels. Finally, ARS upregulates the expression of the adhesion molecules, NCAM and integrin Î²1, and reduces migration and invasiveness of ERMS cells in vitro, and ARS treatment reduces of about 50% the growth of ERMS xenografts in vivo. Our results are the first evidence of efficacy of ART derivatives in restraining ERMS growth in vivo, and suggest ARS as a potential candidate for therapeutic treatment of ERMS.",Carcinogenesis
9,SNAIL is a key regulator of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma tumor growth and differentiation through repression of MYF5 and MYOD function.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is a mesenchymal tumor of soft tissue in children that originates from a myogenic differentiation defect. Expression of SNAIL transcription factor is elevated in the alveolar subtype of RMS (ARMS), characterized by a low myogenic differentiation status and high aggressiveness. In RMS patients SNAIL level increases with higher stage. Moreover, SNAIL level negatively correlates with MYF5 expression. The differentiation of human ARMS cells diminishes SNAIL level. SNAIL silencing in ARMS cells inhibits proliferation and induces differentiation in vitro, and thereby completely abolishes the growth of human ARMS xenotransplants in vivo. SNAIL silencing induces myogenic differentiation by upregulation of myogenic factors and muscle-specific microRNAs, such as miR-206. SNAIL binds to the MYF5 promoter suppressing its expression. SNAIL displaces MYOD from E-box sequences (CANNTG) that are associated with genes expressed during differentiation and G/C rich in their central dinucleotides. SNAIL silencing allows the re-expression of MYF5 and canonical MYOD binding, promoting ARMS cell myogenic differentiation. In differentiating ARMS cells SNAIL forms repressive complex with histone deacetylates 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) and regulates their expression. Accordingly, in human myoblasts SNAIL silencing induces differentiation by upregulation of myogenic factors. Our data clearly point to SNAIL as a key regulator of myogenic differentiation and a new promising target for future ARMS therapies.",Cell death & disease

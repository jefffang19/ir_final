0,"Circulating muscle-specific microRNA, miR-206, as a potential diagnostic marker for rhabdomyosarcoma.","Presently there is no serum biomarker of rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). Several studies have shown that profiles of microRNA (miRNA) expression differ among tumor types. Here we evaluated the feasibility of using muscle-specific miRNAs (miR-1, -133a, -133b and -206) as biomarkers of RMS. Expression of muscle-specific miRNAs, especially miR-206, was significantly higher in RMS cell lines than in other tumor cell lines, as well as in RMS tumor specimens. Further, serum levels of muscle-specific miRNAs were significantly higher in patients with RMS tumors than in patients with non-RMS tumors. Normalized serum miR-206 expression level could be used to differentiate between RMS and non-RMS tumors, with sensitivity of 1.0 and specificity of 0.913. These results raise the possibility of using circulating muscle-specific miRNAs, especially miR-206, as landmark biomarkers for RMS.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications
1,Successful treatment of metastatic alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma with MGMT gene promoter methylation by temozolomide-based combination chemotherapy.,"A 3-year-old male presented with a large retroperitoneal mass and multiple metastases. Biopsy results suggested alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma bearing a methylated O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene promoter. Serum microRNA-206 levels were elevated and remained high after three cycles of vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC). Replacement of vincristine, irinotecan, and temozolomide (VIT) for VAC induced a marked tumor reduction and normalization of the miR-206 levels. The patient completed 14 cycles of VIT with local radiotherapy and has been in remission for 31 months. Temozolomide could be effective for tumors with a methylated MGMT gene promoter. Individualized therapy is warranted for such patients.",Pediatric blood & cancer
2,Downregulation of microRNA-206 is a potent prognostic marker for patients with gastric cancer.,"Background: MicroRNA-206 (miR-206), as a homolog of miR-1, plays important roles in tumorigenesis and tumor progression of various human malignancies, including breast cancer, endometrial endometrioid carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, glioma, lung cancer, and laryngeal cancer. However, its involvement in gastric cancer has remained unclear. Aim: To examine the expression patterns and clinical implications of miR-206 in gastric cancer. Materials and methods: Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to evaluate the expression levels of miR-206 in 98 pairs of gastric cancer and normal adjacent mucosa. In addition, the clinicopathologic significance and the prognostic value of miR-206 expression were further determined. Results: At first, miR-206 expression was significantly downregulated in gastric cancer tissues when compared with normal adjacent mucosa (P<0.001). Next, tumors with low miR-206 expression had a greater extent of lymph node metastasis (P=0.01), presence of venous invasion (P=0.008), and hematogenous recurrence (P=0.01), and were at a worse stage (P=0.03) than the tumors with a high miR-206 expression. Then, the gastric cancer patients with a low miR-206 expression had shorter overall survival than those with a high miR-206 expression (P=0.02). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that miR-206 expression was an independent prognostic factor for patients with gastric cancer. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that the downregulation of miR-206 was significantly correlated with tumor progression and may be a potent prognostic marker of gastric cancer. miR-206 might serve as a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of this cancer.",European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology
3,A selective screening platform reveals unique global expression patterns of microRNAs in a cohort of human soft-tissue sarcomas.,"Sarcomas are malignant heterogenous tumors of mesenchymal derivation. Emerging data suggest that miRNA might have a causal role in sarcomagenesis. Herein, we used a selective miRNA screening platform to study the comparative global miRNA expression signatures in a cohort of human sarcomas with the caveat that comparisons between tumor and non-tumor cells were performed from the same patients using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Five histologic types were examined that included: myxoid liposarcoma, well-differentiated liposarcoma, dedifferentiated liposarcoma, pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. In addition, soft-tissue lipomas and normal fat were included as a separate set of controls for the lipogenic tumors. Clustering analysis showed a distinct global difference in expression patterns between the normal and sarcoma tissues. Expression signatures in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis revealed tight clustering in synovial and myxoid liposarcomas, and the least clustering was observed in the pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma subtype. MiR-145 showed underexpression in pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma, well-differentiated liposarcoma, and synovial sarcoma. Unexpectedly, we found that a set of muscle-specific microRNAs (miRNAs; myomiRs): miR-133, miR-1, and miR-206 was significantly underexpressed in well-differentiated liposarcoma and synovial sarcoma, suggesting that they may function as tumor suppressors as described in muscle-relevant rhabdomyosarcomas. In addition, a tight linear progression of miRNA expression was identified from normal fat to dedifferentiated liposarcoma. These results suggest that miRNA expression profiles could elucidate classes of miRNAs that may elicit tumor-relevant activities in specific sarcoma subtypes.",Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology
4,MicroRNA-206 expression levels correlate with clinical behaviour of rhabdomyosarcomas.,"Background: Rhabdomyosarcomas (RMSs) are primarily paediatric sarcomas that resemble developing skeletal muscle. Our aim was to determine the effects of microRNAs (miRNA) that have been implicated in muscle development on the clinical behaviour of RMSs. Methods: Expression levels of miR-1, miR-206, miR-133a and miR-133b were quantified by RT-PCR in 163 primary paediatric RMSs, plus control tissues, and correlated with clinico-pathological features. Correlations with parallel gene expression profiling data for 84 samples were used to identify pathways associated with miR-206. Synthetic miR-206 was transfected into RMS cell lines and phenotypic responses assessed. Results: Muscle-specific miRNAs levels were lower in RMSs compared with skeletal muscle but generally higher than in other normal tissues. Low miR-206 expression correlated with poor overall survival and was an independent predictor of shorter survival in metastatic embryonal and alveolar cases without PAX3/7-FOXO1 fusion genes. Low miR-206 expression also significantly correlated with high SIOP stage and the presence of metastases at diagnosis. High miR-206 expression strongly correlated with genes linked to muscle differentiation and low expression was associated with genes linked to MAPkinase and NFKappaB pathway activation. Increasing miR-206 expression in cell lines inhibited cell growth and migration and induced apoptosis that was associated with myogenic differentiation in some, but not all, cell lines. Conclusion: miR-206 contributes to the clinical behaviour of RMSs and the pleiotropic effects of miR-206 supports therapeutic potential.",British journal of cancer
5,Heme oxygenase-1 inhibits myoblast differentiation by targeting myomirs.,"Aims: Heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) is a cytoprotective enzyme degrading heme to biliverdin, iron ions, and carbon monoxide, whose expression is induced in response to oxidative stress. Its overexpression has been suggested as a strategy improving survival of transplanted muscle precursors. Results: Here we demonstrated that HMOX1 inhibits differentiation of myoblasts and modulates miRNA processing: downregulates Lin28 and DGCR8, lowers the total pool of cellular miRNAs, and specifically blocks induction of myomirs. Genetic or pharmacological activation of HMOX1 in C2C12 cells reduces the abundance of miR-1, miR-133a, miR-133b, and miR-206, which is accompanied by augmented production of SDF-1 and miR-146a, decreased expression of MyoD, myogenin, and myosin, and disturbed formation of myotubes. Similar relationships between HMOX1 and myomirs were demonstrated in murine primary satellite cells isolated from skeletal muscles of HMOX1(+/+), HMOX1(+/-), and HMOX1(-/-) mice or in human rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines. Inhibition of myogenic development is independent of antioxidative properties of HMOX1. Instead it is mediated by CO-dependent inhibition of c/EBPÎ´ binding to myoD promoter, can be imitated by SDF-1, and partially reversed by enforced expression of miR-133b and miR-206. Control C2C12 myoblasts injected to gastrocnemius muscles of NOD-SCID mice contribute to formation of muscle fibers. In contrast, HMOX1 overexpressing C2C12 myoblasts form fast growing, hyperplastic tumors, infiltrating the surrounding tissues, and disseminating to the lungs. Innovation: We evidenced for the first time that HMOX1 inhibits differentiation of myoblasts, affects the miRNA processing enzymes, and modulates the miRNA transcriptome. Conclusion: HMOX1 improves the survival of myoblasts, but concurrently through regulation of myomirs, may act similarly to oncogenes, increasing the risk of hyperplastic growth of myogenic precursors.",Antioxidants & redox signaling
6,Failure to downregulate the BAF53a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex contributes to the differentiation block in rhabdomyosarcoma.,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children and young adults, is characterized by a partially differentiated myogenic phenotype. We have previously shown that the blocking of tumor growth and resumption of differentiation can be achieved by re-expression of miR-206, a muscle-enriched microRNA missing in RMS. In this work, we focused on BAF53a, one of the genes downregulated in miR-206-expressing RMS cells, which codes for a subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex. Here we show that the BAF53a transcript is significantly higher in primary RMS tumors than in normal muscle, and is a direct target of miR-206. Sustained expression of BAF53a interferes with differentiation in myogenic cells, whereas its silencing in RMS cells increases expression of myogenic markers and inhibits proliferation and anchorage-independent growth. Accordingly, BAF53a silencing also impairs embryonal RMS and alveolar RMS tumor growth, inducing their morphological and biochemical differentiation. These results indicate that failure to downregulate the BAF53a subunit may contribute to the pathogenesis of RMS, and suggest that BAF53a may represent a novel therapeutic target for this tumor.",Oncogene
7,MicroRNA reexpression as differentiation therapy in cancer.,"Since their discovery in the early 2000s, microRNAs (miRNAs) and their penchant for RNA interference have taken the scientific community by storm, working their way into virtually every corner of biological inquiry. The very nature of their action, the ability to simultaneously extinguish the expression of a multitude of genes and negate their functions, immediately suggested therapeutic promise. In this issue of the JCI, a step toward the realization of this promise is described. Taulli et al. demonstrate that the miRNAs miR-1/miR-206, which are routinely lost in advanced, poorly differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) but characteristically expressed in the mature skeletal muscle from which these tumors arise, restore the myogenic differentiation program and block the tumorigenic phenotype (see the related article beginning on page 2366). Their data support the notion that these small RNAs, effectively functioning as ""micro-sheriffs"" by restoring myogenic law and order, hold substantial clinical potential as differentiation therapy for RMS and perhaps other solid tumors. miRNA reexpression therapy constitutes a novel approach to handcuff oncogenes and arrest tumor development.",The Journal of clinical investigation

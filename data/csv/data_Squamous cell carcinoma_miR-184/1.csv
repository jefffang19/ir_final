0,miR-184 promotes cell proliferation in tongue squamous cell carcinoma by targeting SOX7.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the miR-184 could regulate the proliferation of the tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) through sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7) gene. miR-184 expression was upregulated in TSCC cell lines and tissues. MTT assay revealed that overexpression of miR-184 significantly promoted the proliferation of the TSCC cells in vitro. SOX7 was the direct target of miR-184 and luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-184 downregulated the expression of SOX7. MTT assay verified that knockdown of SOX7 remarkably promoted the proliferation of TSCC cells in vitro. miR-184 promoted the proliferation of TSCC by targeting SOX7. Taken together, our results provided a new potential therapeutic target for TSCC treatment.",Oncology letters
1,Mature miR-184 and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.,Human microRNA 184 (miR-184) is overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue. In vitro inhibition of miR-184 levels could induce apoptosis and hinder proliferation of tongue SCC cells. Patients with tongue SCC have high plasma miR-184 levels. Plasma miR-184 is likely associated with the tumor load. Surgical removal of the primary tumor reduced plasma miR-184 levels significantly. The data suggested that miR-184 is linked to the pathogenesis of tongue SCC. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the use of microRNA-based serological markers in monitoring tongue SCC.,TheScientificWorldJournal
2,Mature miR-184 as Potential Oncogenic microRNA of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Tongue.,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microRNA expression patterns in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue. Experimental design: Expression levels of 156 human mature microRNAs were examined using real-time quantitative PCR (Taq Man MicroRNA Assays; Human Panel) on laser microdissected cells of 4 tongue carcinomas and paired normal tissues. Expression of mature miR-184 was further validated in 20 paired tongue SCC and the normal tissues. Potential oncogenic functions of miR-184 were evaluated in tongue SCC cell lines (Cal27, HN21B, and HN96) with miR-184 inhibitor. Plasma miR-184 levels were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Using 3-fold expression difference as a cutoff level, we identified 24 up-regulated mature miRNAs including miR-184, miR-34c, miR-137, miR-372, miR-124a, miR-21, miR-124b, miR-31, miR-128a, miR-34b, miR-154, miR-197, miR-132, miR-147, miR-325, miR-181c, miR-198, miR-155, miR-30a-3p, miR-338, miR-17-5p, miR-104, miR-134, and miR-213; and 13 down-regulated mature miRNAs including miR-133a, miR-99a, miR-194, miR-133b, miR-219, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-26b, miR-138, miR-149, miR-195, miR-107, and miR-139. Overexpression of miR-184 was further validated in 20 paired tongue SCC and normal tissues (P = 0.002). Inhibition of miR-184 in tongue SCC cell lines could reduce cell proliferation rate. Down-regulation of c-Myc was observed in two cell lines in response to miR-184 inhibitor. Suppressing miR-184 could induce apoptosis in all three cell lines. Plasma miR-184 levels were significantly higher in tongue SCC patients in comparison with normal individuals, and the levels were significantly reduced after surgical removal of the primary tumors. Conclusions: Overexpression of miR-184 might play an oncogenic role in the antiapoptotic and proliferative processes of tongue SCC. In addition, plasma miR-184 levels were associated with the presence of primary tumor. Further studies on the aberrantly expressed miRNAs in tongue SCC as well as using plasma miRNAs as novel tumor markers are warranted.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
3,LncRNA UCA1 promotes proliferation and cisplatin resistance of oral squamous cell carcinoma by sunppressing miR-184 expression.,"Chemotherapy resistance has become the main obstacle for the effective treatment of human cancers. Long non-coding RNA urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1) is generally regarded as an oncogene in some cancers. However, the function and molecular mechanism of UCA1 implicated in cisplatin (CDDP) chemoresistance of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is still not fully established. UCA1 expression in tumor tissues and cells was tested by qRT-PCR. MTT, flow cytometry and caspase-3 activity analysis were explored to evaluate the CDDP sensitivity in OSCC cells. Western blot analysis was used to measure BCL2, Bax and SF1 protein expression. Luciferase reporter assay was conducted to investigate the molecular relationship between UCA1, miR-184, and SF1. Nude mice model was used to confirm the functional role of UCA1 in CDDP resistance in vivo. UCA1 expression was upregulated in OSCC tissues, cell lines, and CDDP resistant OSCC cells. Function analysis revealed that UCA1 facilitated proliferation, enhanced CDDP chemoresistance, and suppressed apoptosis in OSCC cells. Mechanisms investigation indicated that UCA1 could interact with miR-184 to repress its expression. Rescue experiments suggested that downregulation of miR-184 partly reversed the tumor suppression effect and CDDP chemosensitivity of UCA1 knockdown in CDDP-resistant OSCC cells. Moreover, UCA1 could perform as a miR-184 sponge to modulate SF1 expression. The OSCC nude mice model experiments demonstrated that depletion of UCA1 further boosted CDDP-mediated repression effect on tumor growth. UCA1 accelerated proliferation, increased CDDP chemoresistance and restrained apoptosis partly through modulating SF1 via sponging miR-184 in OSCC cells, suggesting that targeting UCA1 may be a potential therapeutic strategy for OSCC patients.",Cancer medicine

5,"Aberrant Expression of miR-103, miR-184, miR-378, miR-497 and miR-506 in Tumor Tissue from Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Regulates the Clinical Picture of the Patients.","Background: This study aimed to evaluate the expression patterns of miR-103, miR-184, miR-378, miR497 and in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue and to be compared with normal peripheral tissues. Methods: Tumor and marginal tissues were obtained from 50 patients with OSCC. After RNA extraction, expression level of miR-103, miR-184, miR-378, miR497, and miR506 was estimated using SYBR green master mix and real-time quantitative PCR. Results: It was observed that, there was no detectable difference in expression level of miR-103 between tumoral and marginal tissues. However, expression level of miR-184, and miR-378 showed significant increase in tumor tissue samples compared to marginal tissue samples. MiR-497 and miR-506 demonstrated considerable decrease in tumoral cells in comparison with peripheral tissues. Moreover, the expression level of miRNAs was associated with clinicopathological features of the patients. Conclusions: Our data indicated that miR-184, miR-378, miR-497, and miR-506 can be used as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in OSCC. Nevertheless, more studies are needed to confirm this claim.<br />.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
6,"MicroRNA-184 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion, and specifically targets TNFAIP2 in Glioma.","Background: miRNA-184 is an oncogene in human hepatocellular carcinoma but acts as a tumor suppressor in tongue squamous cell carcinoma. Studies have shown that miR-184 was down-regulated in glioma and TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2) was closely related to tumorigenesis. This study aimed to determine the functions of miR-184 in glioma and the mechanisms of miRNA-184-TNFAIP2 mediated glioma progression. Methods: Real-time reverse-transcription PCR detected expression of miR-184 and TNFAIP2. U87 and U251 cells were transfected with miR-184 mimic, inhibitor, or negative control miRNA, and their invasion abilities were assayed. Cellular proliferation was measured by the cell counting kit-8 assay. miR-184 effects on glioma cell apoptosis and cell cycle were assessed by flow cytometer. Biological information software have predicted that miR-184 could target TNFα-induced protein 2 (TNFAIP2), Which was further validated by Western blot and qRT-PCR in glioma cells. In vivo, U87 cells transduced with either lentiviral over-expressed miR-184 or control lentivirus were injected into nude mice subcutaneously and intracranial respectively. Results: Expression of miR-184 was significantly lower in glioma tissues and cell-lines compared to normal brain tissues. Protein and mRNA expression of TNFAIP2 were inversely correlated with miR-184 in glioma. In vitro, proliferation and invasion abilities were also decreased in U87 and U251 cells after transfection with miR-184 mimic. In vivo, the xenografted tumor size in the miR-184 overexpressing group were smaller than the miR-NC group. Concordantly, U87 and U251 cells transfected with miR-184 mimic had a higher apoptosis rate, triggering an accumulation of cells at the G0/G1 phase and decreased cells in S-phase. Conclusions: miR-184 could regulate TNFAIP2 expression and affected its translation in glioma. miR-184 could also inhibit glioma progression and might serve as a novel therapeutic target in glioma.",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR

9,"Altered levels of miR-21, miR-125b-2*, miR-138, miR-155, miR-184, and miR-205 in oral squamous cell carcinoma and association with clinicopathological characteristics.","Background: Previous studies have described the aberrantly expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and we reasoned that studying frequently deregulated candidate miRNAs in OSCC of Indian ethnicity could aid in better understanding of the genetic/environmental impact on the expression statuses of these miRNAs. Therefore, we evaluated the differential expression of six selected miRNAs namely hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-125b2*, hsa-miR-138, hsa-miR-155, hsa-miR-184, and hsa-miR-205 in OSCC specimens of Indian ethnicity. Methods: Two-step Reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR using inventoried TaqMan single miRNA assays was employed to study the expression of the selected miRNAs in 42 OSCC tumors and eight adjacent normal specimens. The expression levels of the miRNAs were tested for any association with clinicopathological parameters. Results: miR-21 was significantly elevated while miR-125b-2* was significantly downregulated in tumors compared to controls (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively). miR-138 and miR-184 were observed to be predominantly downregulated in the tumor samples. High levels of miR-155 were associated with the habit of chewing tobacco/betel quid. Conclusions: Our results corroborate the previous findings on the overexpression of mir-21 and downregulation of miR-138 in OSCC. As the expression of miR-184 is controversial in tongue/oral cancer, the downregulation may be specific to tumor anatomical localization. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to show the association of miR-155 with tobacco chewing and the downregulation of miR-125b-2* in OSCC. Computational predictions suggest that miR-125b-2* may have a role in alternative splicing.",Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology
10,A functional variant at the miR-184 binding site in TNFAIP2 and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.,"Although the role of TNFAIP2 is still unclear, it is an important gene involved in apoptosis, and there are single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at its microRNA (miRNA)-binding sites that could modulate miRNA target gene function. In this study, we evaluated associations of four selected SNPs (rs8126 T > C, rs710100 G > A, rs1052912 G > A and rs1052823 G > T) in the miRNA-binding sites of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) risk in 1077 patients with SCCHN and 1073 cancer-free controls in a non-Hispanic White population. We found that, compared with the rs8126 TT genotype, the variant C allele were associated with increased SCCHN risk in an allele dose-response manner (adjusted odds ratio = 1.48 and 95% confidence interval = 1.06-2.05 for CC, respectively; P(trend) = 0.009). No significant associations were seen for the other three SNPs (rs710100 G > A, rs1052912 G > A and rs1052823 G > T). Additionally, we identified that the rs8126 T > C SNP is within the miR-184 seed binding region in the 3' UTR of TNFAIP2. Further functional analyses showed that the rs8126 variant C allele led to significantly lower luciferase activity, compared with the T allele. In the genotype-phenotype correlation analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 64 SCCHN patients, the rs8126 CC genotype was associated with reduced expression of TNFAIP2 messenger RNA. Taken together, these findings indicate that the miR-184 binding site SNP (rs8126 T > C) in the 3' UTR of TNFAIP2 is functional by modulating TNFAIP2 expression and contributes to SCCHN susceptibility. Larger replication studies are needed to confirm our findings.",Carcinogenesis
11,[The research advances of microRNA-184 and related ocular diseases].,"microRNA-184 (miR-184) is a small, non-coding, endogenic RNA molecule of 22 nucleotides in length. It is a highly conserved sequence throughout many different species. Multiple studies have demonstrated that miR-184 is an important factor in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. miR-184 plays vital roles in many biological processes, including development and differentiation in many tissues and organs. Meanwhile, the research on the physiological and pathological role of miR-184 in eyes draws more and more attention lately. Recent research indicates that miR-184 is highly expressed in the cornea and lens of mice. miR-184 plays crucial regulatory roles in several ocular diseases, such as neovascularization, keratoconus, endothelial dystrophy-iris hypoplasia-congenital cataract-stromal thinning syndrome, corneal squamous cell carcinoma, age-related macular degeneration and cataract. Here we summarize and discuss the recent findings of miR-184 in its gene structure, gene expression and regulation, biological function and its relevance with ocular diseases.

12,Circulating miRNA is a novel marker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"The aim of the study is to investigate the alteration of plasma miRNA in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Altered microRNAs (miRNAs) expression has been found in many cancers, including lung cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, bladder cancer and colorectal cancer. Many recent studies have demonstrated that aberrant plasma miRNAs were also found in various types of cancers. However the alteration of plasma expression in HNSCC remains unclear. In this present study, the expression profiles of ten miRNAs, let-7a, miR-21, miR26b, miR-34c, miR-99a, miR-133a, miR-137, miR-184, miR-194a, and miR-375, in plasma from 50 patients and 36 healthy subjects were evaluated using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Our results demonstrated that the expression level of miR-21 was significantly up-regulated in plasma samples obtained from HNSCC patients (p < 0.01) than those from healthy subjects, which were in consistent with our finding in HNSCC tissues. A 7.7-fold increase of miR-21 in cancerous parts when compared to their non-cancerous counterparts (p < 0.0001) was observed in HNSCC tissues. In addition, the expression levels of miR-21 and miR-26b were both reduced in post-operative HNSCC patients with good prognosis. In contrast, the concentration of plasma miR-21 and miR-26b stayed high after tumor removal in the expired cases. Our study suggests that detecting circulating miR-21 and miR-26b pre- and post-operatively might provide a novel tumor marker for HNSCC.",Tumour biology : the journal of the International Society for Oncodevelopmental Biology and Medicine

0,miR-184 promotes cell proliferation in tongue squamous cell carcinoma by targeting SOX7.,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the miR-184 could regulate the proliferation of the tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCC) through sex-determining region Y-box 7 (SOX7) gene. miR-184 expression was upregulated in TSCC cell lines and tissues. MTT assay revealed that overexpression of miR-184 significantly promoted the proliferation of the TSCC cells in vitro. SOX7 was the direct target of miR-184 and luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-184 downregulated the expression of SOX7. MTT assay verified that knockdown of SOX7 remarkably promoted the proliferation of TSCC cells in vitro. miR-184 promoted the proliferation of TSCC by targeting SOX7. Taken together, our results provided a new potential therapeutic target for TSCC treatment.",Oncology letters
1,Mature miR-184 and squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue.,Human microRNA 184 (miR-184) is overexpressed in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue. In vitro inhibition of miR-184 levels could induce apoptosis and hinder proliferation of tongue SCC cells. Patients with tongue SCC have high plasma miR-184 levels. Plasma miR-184 is likely associated with the tumor load. Surgical removal of the primary tumor reduced plasma miR-184 levels significantly. The data suggested that miR-184 is linked to the pathogenesis of tongue SCC. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the use of microRNA-based serological markers in monitoring tongue SCC.,TheScientificWorldJournal
2,Mature miR-184 as Potential Oncogenic microRNA of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Tongue.,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microRNA expression patterns in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue. Experimental design: Expression levels of 156 human mature microRNAs were examined using real-time quantitative PCR (Taq Man MicroRNA Assays; Human Panel) on laser microdissected cells of 4 tongue carcinomas and paired normal tissues. Expression of mature miR-184 was further validated in 20 paired tongue SCC and the normal tissues. Potential oncogenic functions of miR-184 were evaluated in tongue SCC cell lines (Cal27, HN21B, and HN96) with miR-184 inhibitor. Plasma miR-184 levels were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Using 3-fold expression difference as a cutoff level, we identified 24 up-regulated mature miRNAs including miR-184, miR-34c, miR-137, miR-372, miR-124a, miR-21, miR-124b, miR-31, miR-128a, miR-34b, miR-154, miR-197, miR-132, miR-147, miR-325, miR-181c, miR-198, miR-155, miR-30a-3p, miR-338, miR-17-5p, miR-104, miR-134, and miR-213; and 13 down-regulated mature miRNAs including miR-133a, miR-99a, miR-194, miR-133b, miR-219, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-26b, miR-138, miR-149, miR-195, miR-107, and miR-139. Overexpression of miR-184 was further validated in 20 paired tongue SCC and normal tissues (P = 0.002). Inhibition of miR-184 in tongue SCC cell lines could reduce cell proliferation rate. Down-regulation of c-Myc was observed in two cell lines in response to miR-184 inhibitor. Suppressing miR-184 could induce apoptosis in all three cell lines. Plasma miR-184 levels were significantly higher in tongue SCC patients in comparison with normal individuals, and the levels were significantly reduced after surgical removal of the primary tumors. Conclusions: Overexpression of miR-184 might play an oncogenic role in the antiapoptotic and proliferative processes of tongue SCC. In addition, plasma miR-184 levels were associated with the presence of primary tumor. Further studies on the aberrantly expressed miRNAs in tongue SCC as well as using plasma miRNAs as novel tumor markers are warranted.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
3,Circulating microRNAs in plasma of patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Several recent studies demonstrated that microRNAs (miRNAs) are stably detectable in plasma/serum. We hypothesised that plasma miRNAs concentrations contributed to potential biomarkers in patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: We selected three oncogenic miRNAs (miR-21, miR-184, miR-221) and one tumour suppressive miRNA (miR-375), which are frequently reported in squamous cell carcinoma, as candidate targets for this plasma miRNA assay. This study was divided into three steps: (1) Determination of appropriate plasma miRNAs in preliminary tests. (2) Evaluation of whether the plasma miRNA assays could monitor tumour dynamics. (3) Validation study on the clinical application of plasma miRNA assays in 50 ESCC patients and 20 healthy volunteers. Results: (1) In preliminary tests, the plasma level of miR-21 was significantly higher (P=0.0218) and that of miR-375 (P=0.0052) was significantly lower in ESCC patients than controls. (2) The high plasma miR-21 levels reflected tumour levels in all cases (100%). The plasma level of miR-21 was significantly reduced in postoperative samples (P=0.0058). (3) On validation analysis, the plasma level of miR-21 tended to be higher in ESCC patients (P=0.0649), while that of miR-375 was significantly lower (P<0.0001) and the miR-21/miR-375 ratio was significantly higher (P<0.0001) in ESCC patients than in controls. The value of the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.816 for the miR-21/miR-375 ratio assay. Patients with a high plasma level of miR-21 tended to have greater vascular invasion (P=0.1554) and to show a high correlation with recurrence (P=0.0164). Conclusion: Detection of circulating miRNAs might provide new complementary tumour markers for ESCC.",British journal of cancer
4,miRNA expression profiles of premalignant and malignant arsenic-induced skin lesions.,"Arsenic, a naturally occurring element, contaminates the drinking water of over 200 million people globally. Chronic arsenic exposure causes multiple cancers including those originating from skin, lung and bladder, and is associated with liver, kidney, and prostate cancers. Skin is the primary target organ for arsenic toxicity; chronic toxicity initially manifests as non-malignant hyperkeratoses (HK) and subsequently advances to malignant lesions, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC). In this study, we evaluate the miRNA expression profiles of premalignant (3 HK) and malignant (3 BCC and 3 SCC) skin lesions from individuals chronically exposed to high levels of arsenic (59-172 ppb) in their drinking water in West Bengal, India. The lesions were histologically complex requiring histopathologic identification of keratinocytes to be isolated for RNA analyses. Keratinocytes were harvested using Laser Capture Microdissection and miRNA expression profiles were determined using TaqManÂ® Array Human MiRNA A Card v2.0. Thirty-five miRNAs were differentially expressed among the three lesion types analyzed. Two miRNAs (miR-425-5p and miR-433) were induced in both BCC and SCC relative to HK indicating their association with malignancy. Two other miRNAs (miR-184 and miR-576-3p) were induced in SCC relative to both BCC and HK suggesting selective induction in tumors capable of metastasis. Six miRNAs (miR-29c, miR-381, miR-452, miR-487b, miR-494 and miR-590-5p) were selectively suppressed in BCC relative to both SCC and HK. In conclusion, the differential miRNA expression was both phenotype- and stage-related. These miRNAs are potential biomarkers and may serve as therapy targets for arsenic-induced internal tumors.",PloS one
5,Candidate tumour suppressor CCDC19 regulates miR-184 direct targeting of C-Myc thereby suppressing cell growth in non-small cell lung cancers.,"We previously reported and revised the nasopharyngeal epithelium specific protein CCDC19 and identified it as a potential tumour suppressor in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to investigate the involvement of CCDC19 in the pathogenesis of human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Down-regulated CCDC19 expression was observed in NSCLC tissues and cells compared to normal tissues. However, reduced protein expression did not correlate with the status of NSCLC progression. Instead, we observed that patients with lower CCDC19 expression had a shorter overall survival than did patients with higher CCDC19 expression. Lentiviral-mediated CCDC19 overexpression significantly suppressed cell proliferation and cell cycle transition from G1 to S and G2 phases in NSCLC cells. Knocking down CCDC19 expression significantly restored the ability of cell growth in CCDC19 overexpressing NSCLC cells. Mechanistically CCDC19 functions as a potential tumour suppressor by stimulating miR-184 suppression of C-Myc thus blocking cell growth mediated by the PI3K/AKT/C-Jun pathway. Our studies are the first to demonstrate that reduced expression of CCDC19 is an unfavourable factor in NSCLC.",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine
6,A functional TNFAIP2 3'-UTR rs8126 genetic polymorphism contributes to risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Accumulated evidences demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) may impact microRNAs (miRNAs)-mediated expression regulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressors. There is a TNFAIP2 3'-UTR rs8126 T>C genetic variant which has been proved to be associated with head and neck cancer susceptibility. This SNP could disturb binding of miR-184 with TNFAIP2 mRNA and influence TNFAIP2 regulation. However, it is still unclear how this polymorphism is involved in development of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Therefore, we hypothesized that the functional TNFAIP2 rs8126 SNP may affect TNFAIP2 expression and, thus, ESCC risk. Methods: We investigated the association between the TNFAIP2 rs8126 variant and ESCC risk as well as the functional relevance on TNFAIP2 expression in vivo. Genotypes were determined in a case-control set consisted of 588 ESCC patients and 600 controls. The allele-specific regulation on TNFAIP2 expression by the rs8126 SNP was examined in normal and cancerous tissue specimens of esophagus. Results: We found that individuals carrying the rs8126 CC or CT genotype had an OR of 1.89 (95%CI = 1.23-2.85, P = 0.003) or 1.38 (95%CI = 1.05-1.73, P = 0.017) for developing ESCC in Chinese compared with individual carrying the TT genotype. Carriers of the rs8126 CC and CT genotypes had significantly lower TNFAIP2 mRNA levels than those with the TT genotypes in normal esophagus tissues (P<0.05). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that functional TNFAIP2 rs8126 genetic variant is a ESCC susceptibility SNP. These results support the hypothesis that genetic variants interrupting miRNA-mediated gene regulation might be important genetic modifiers of cancer risk.",PloS one
7,The increase of oncogenic miRNA expression in tongue carcinogenesis of a mouse model.,"Objectives: This study investigated the oncogenic miRNA level in the tissue and biofluids in the Nitroquinoline 1-Oxide (4NQO)-induced mouse tongue carcinogenesis model for potential diagnostic or therapeutic application. Materials and methods: The histological examination, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, quantitative PCR analysis and bioinformatic algorithms were performed to unravel the signaling activation and miRNA expression in female murine samples. Results: The increase of miR-21 and miR-31 staining, and EGFR activation paralleled the severity of 4NQO-induced epithelial pathogenesis in tongue epithelium. A progressive increase of miR-21, miR-31 and miR-146a in both saliva and plasma samples was also noted. miR-31 was the earliest emerging miRNA in the saliva. The increase of plasma miR-146a, miR-184 and miR-372 was detectable early in the induction, and it was particularly eminent at the most advanced lesion state. The combined analysis of the multiple oncogenic miRNAs in the plasma signified a potent discriminative capacity between normal and pathological states. As the blockage of EGFR or AKT activation drastically reverted the miR-21, miR-31 and miR-146a expression induced by 4NQO in human oral carcinoma cell lines, the results implicated a mechanistic linkage of the oncogenic miRNAs' induction through EGFR/AKT activation. Conclusions: In this study, we show the dysregulation of oncogenic miRNAs in murine tongue tumorigenesis, which simulates human counterparts. Increased multiple miRNAs in the biofluids may be valuable non-invasive markers in detecting oral carcinogenesis at an early stage. This animal model may also be useful for developing liquid biopsies and prevention strategies against oral carcinoma by abrogating EGFR or oncogenic miRNAs.",Oral oncology
8,Co-targeting of multiple microRNAs on factor-Inhibiting hypoxia-Inducible factor gene for the pathogenesis of head and neck carcinomas.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that inhibit the expression of target genes that play roles in tumorigenesis. MiR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 are oncogenic miRNAs for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Factor-inhibiting hypoxia (FIH)-inducible factor is known to inactivate hypoxia-induced downstream effectors and is involved in HNSCC suppression. This study investigates whether miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 target FIH in HNSCC. Methods: Reporter assays, Western blot analysis, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and phenotypic assays were used to prove that miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 directly target FIH. Clinicopathological implications of the gene expression were also analyzed. Results: MiR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 directly bind to various sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of FIH transcript, and this binding is associated with decreased FIH protein expression in HNSCC cells. Treatment with the precursors of these miRNAs increases the proliferation and migration of HNSCC cells. Concomitant treatment with precursors repressed FIH and enhanced oncogenicity most profoundly. Upregulation of miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 expression is found in more than 80% of HNSCC tumors and 72% of tumors have concordant upregulation of these 3 oncogenic miRNAs. The highest expression of these miRNAs is present in T4b and stage IVB tumors. Downregulation of FIH mRNA expression is noted in 69% of HNSCC tumors, and in tumors exhibiting high expression of these miRNAs, the FIH mRNA expression is consistently downregulated. Conclusion: This study provides novel clues indicating that miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 co-target FIH tumor suppressor during pathogenesis in the vast majority of HNSCC.",Head & neck
9,MicroRNA-184 antagonizes microRNA-205 to maintain SHIP2 levels in epithelia.,"Despite their potential to regulate approximately one-third of the whole genome, relatively few microRNA (miRNA) targets have been experimentally validated, particularly in stratified squamous epithelia. Here we demonstrate not only that the lipid phosphatase SHIP2 is a target of miRNA-205 (miR-205) in epithelial cells, but, more importantly, that the corneal epithelial-specific miR-184 can interfere with the ability of miR-205 to suppress SHIP2 levels. This is the first example of a miRNA negatively regulating another to maintain levels of a target protein. Interfering with miR-205 function by using a synthetic antagomir, or by the ectopic expression of miR-184, leads to a coordinated damping of the Akt signaling pathway via SHIP2 induction. This was associated with a marked increase in keratinocyte apoptosis and cell death. Aggressive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells exhibited elevated levels of miR-205. This was associated with a concomitant reduction in SHIP2 levels. Partial knockdown of endogenous miR-205 in SCCs markedly decreased phosphorylated Akt and phosphorylated BAD levels and increased apoptosis. We were able to increase SHIP2 levels in SCC cells after inhibition of miR-205. Therefore, miR-205 might have diagnostic value in determining the aggressivity of SCCs. Blockage of miR-205 activity with an antagomir or via ectopic expression of miR-184 could be novel therapeutic approaches for treating aggressive SCCs.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America

0,Exploiting salivary miR-31 as a clinical biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Oral carcinoma is an important malignancy throughout the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional levels of targeted mRNAs. MiRNA-31(miR-31) is significantly upregulated in oral carcinoma tissues and plays oncogenic roles in oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the levels of miR-31 in saliva of patients with oral carcinoma (n = 45), oral verrucous leukoplakia (n = 10), and control healthy individuals (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Salivary miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors. However, our preliminary analysis showed no increase of salivary miR-31 in patients with oral verrucous leukoplakia relative to controls. The miR-31 was more abundant in saliva than in plasma, suggesting salivary miR-31 was a more sensitive marker for oral malignancy. After excision of oral carcinoma, salivary miR-31 was remarkably reduced, indicating that most of the upregulated salivary miR-31 came from tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results point to a potential application of salivary miR-31 as a biomarker for early detection and postoperative follow-up of oral carcinoma.",Head & neck
1,miR-31 targets ARID1A and enhances the oncogenicity and stemness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 is oncogenic for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Proteins containing the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID) modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcription machinery needed for gene expression. In this study, we showed that miR-31 was able to target ARID1A in HNSCC. HNSCC tumors had an inverse miR-31 and ARID1A expression. miR-31 associated oncogenicities were rescued by ARID1A expression in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ARID1A repressed the stemness properties and transcriptional activity of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM via the protein's affinity for AT-rich sites within promoters. HNSCC patients with tumors having high level of miR-31 expression and high levels of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM expression, together with low level of ARID1A expression, were found to have the worst survival. This study provides novel mechanistic clues demonstrating that miR-31 inhibits ARID1A and that this enriches the oncogenicity and stemness of HNSCC.",Oncotarget
2,MiR-31-5p-ACOX1 Axis Enhances Tumorigenic Fitness in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Via the Promigratory Prostaglandin E2.,"During neoplastic development, a multitude of changes in genome-encoded information are progressively selected to confer growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. microRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks, given their role as a critical layer of robust gene expression control, are frequently altered in neoplasm. However, whether and how these gene perturbations impact metabolic homeostasis remains largely unresolved. Methods: Through targeted miRNA expression screening, we uncovered an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-associated miRNAome, among which miR-31-5p was identified based on extent of up-regulation, functional impact on OSCC cell migration and invasion, and direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal β-oxidation, ACOX1. Results: We further found that both miR-31-5p and ACOX1 underpin, in an antagonistic manner, the overall cellular lipidome profiles as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC cells. Interestingly, the extracellular levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate of ACOX1, were controlled by the miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis, and were shown to positively influence the extent of cell motility in correlation with metastatic status. The promigratory effect of this metabolite was mediated by an elevation in EP1-ERK-MMP9 signaling. Of note, functional significance of this regulatory pathway was further corroborated by its clinicopathologically-correlated expression in OSCC patient specimens. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings outlined a model whereby misregulated miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis in tumor alters lipid metabolomes, consequently eliciting an intracellular signaling change to enhance cell motility. Our clinical analysis also unveiled PGE2 as a viable salivary biomarker for prognosticating oral cancer progression, further underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis.",Theranostics
3,circRNA_0000140 suppresses oral squamous cell carcinoma growth and metastasis by targeting miR-31 to inhibit Hippo signaling pathway.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most common malignancies and has a poor prognosis. Circular RNA (circRNA) has been increasingly recognized as a crucial contributor to carcinogenesis. circRNA_0000140 has been aberrantly expressed in OSCC, but its role in tumor growth and metastasis remains largely unclear. Sanger sequencing, actinomycin D, and RNase R treatments were used to confirm head-to-tail junction sequences and the stability of circ_0000140. In vitro cell activities, including proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis, were determined by colony formation, transwell, and flow cytometry assays. The expression levels of circ_0000140, Hippo signaling pathway, and serial epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were measured by quantitative real-time PCR, western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry. Dual luciferase reporter assays and Argonaute 2-RNA immunoprecipitation assays were performed to explore the interplay among circ_0000140, miR-31, and LATS2. Subcutaneous tumor growth was observed in nude mice, in which in vivo metastasis was observed following tail vein injection of OSCC cells. circ_0000140 is derived from exons 7 to 10 of the KIAA0907 gene. It was down-regulated in OSCC tissues and cell lines, and correlated negatively with poor prognostic outcomes in OSCC patients. Gain-of-function experiments demonstrated that circ_0000140 enhancement suppressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and facilitated cell apoptosis in vitro. In xenograft mouse models, overexpression of circ_0000140 was able to repress tumor growth and lung metastasis. Furthermore, mechanistic studies showed that circ_0000140 could bind with miR-31 and up-regulate its target gene LATS2, thus affecting OSCC cellular EMT. Our findings demonstrated the roles of circ_0000140 in OSCC tumorigenesis as well as in metastasis, and circ_0000140 exerts its tumor-suppressing effect through miR-31/LATS2 axis of Hippo signaling pathway in OSCC.",Cell death & disease
4,A Study on the Correlations of the miR-31 Expression with the Pathogenesis and Prognosis of Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Objective: To investigate the correlations of miR-31 expression with cell proliferation, invasion, and prognosis of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Methods: The expression of miR-31 in human laryngeal cancer TU686 cells, human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE-2 cells, and normal human oral keratinocyte (NHOK) epithelial cells was detected via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The effects of miR-31 on the proliferation and invasion of HNSCC cells were explored through transfecting miR-31 analogs (miR-31 mimics) and miR-31 inhibitors (anti-miR-31). qRT-PCR was applied to detect the expressions of miR-31 in 56 cases of HNSCC tumor tissues and tumor-adjacent normal tissues. The correlation of miR-31 expression with pathological parameters and survival prognosis of HNSCC patients was also analyzed. Results: The expressions of miR-31 in TU686 and CNE-2 cell lines were significantly higher than that in NHOK cells (p < 0.01). Compared with those in the negative control group, the proliferation and invasion abilities of cells transfected with miR-31 mimics were notably enhanced (p < 0.01), and those of cells transfected with anti-miR-31 were significantly reduced (p < 0.01). In addition, miR-31 mimics significantly reduced ARID1A expression (p < 0.01) and anti-miR-31 increased its expression (p < 0.05). The expression of miR-31 in tumor tissues of HNSCC patients was remarkably higher than that in tumor-adjacent normal tissues (p < 0.01). This, together with clinical data analysis, revealed that the expression of miR-31 was associated with tumor differentiation, metastasis, and staging of patients, and the survival period of patients with lowly expressed miR-31 was longer. Conclusions: The highly expressed miR-31 can stimulate the proliferation and invasion of HNSCC cells, closely correlated with tumor differentiation, metastasis, and staging of patients. Patients with lowly expressed miR-31 have a longer survival period. Therefore, miR-31 expression can be taken as a crucial reference indicator for the prognosis of HNSCC patients.",Cancer biotherapy & radiopharmaceuticals

6,MiR-31 is a potential biomarker for diagnosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, their potential clinical value as biomarkers remains poorly known. The aim of this study was to assess the association between tissue/serum miR-31 expression levels and prognosis of HNSCC. In this clinical study, tumor samples were obtained from 118 patients with HNSCC and 48 patients with oral epithelial dysplasia, and blood samples were collected from all the HNSCC cases and 60 normal controls. The expression levels of tissue/serum miR-31 were measured by real-time PCR. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the correlation between tissue/serum miR-31 and clinical parameters of HNSCC. Survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to estimate independent predictors of survival for HNSCC. Our findings showed that tissue miR-31 levels in HNSCC tumor specimens exhibited higher than that in oral epithelial dysplasia samples and normal tissues. Oral epithelial dysplasia with higher expression of miR-31 was more prone to progress into HNSCC. Likewise, serum miR-31 expression in HNSCC patients was markedly increased in compared to normal controls. Moreover, serum miR-31 performed well to distinguish HNSCC subjects from controls. In addition, increased tissue/serum miR-31 expression was positively correlated with poor clinical variables and dismal prognosis. Finally, tissue miR-31 was confirmed to be an independent prognostic factor for HNSCC. Taken together, miR-31 had strong potential as a promising biomarker in HNSCC detection.",International journal of clinical and experimental pathology
7,MicroRNA expression patterns in oral squamous cell carcinoma: hsa-mir-99b-3p and hsa-mir-100-5p as novel prognostic markers for oral cancer.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNA) recently evolved as potential cancer biomarkers. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of eight miRNAs connected to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Method: Expression levels of hsa-mir-21-5p, hsa-mir-29b-3p, hsa-mir-31-5p, hsa-mir-99a-5p, hsa-mir-99b-3p, hsa-mir-100-5p, hsa-mir-143-3p and hsa-mir-155-5p were analyzed in tumor tissue (n = 36) and healthy oral mucosal tissue (n = 17) and correlated with clinical variables. Results of the study cohort were validated in an OSCC cohort of The Cancer Genome Atlas. Results: Increased hsa-mir-99b-3p expression level showed a tendency toward advanced tumor stages, and high levels of hsa-mir-100-5p expression were associated with extracapsular extension. While a high expression level of hsa-mir-99b-3p was associated with better survival, a high expression level of hsa-mir-100-5p was correlated with a poorer survival in the study cohort. Conclusion: Our results indicate that hsa-mir-99b-3p and hsa-mir-100-5p may serve as novel prognostic biomarkers in OSCC.",Head & neck
8,Long non-coding RNA LOC554202 promotes laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma progression through regulating miR-31.,"Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is one aggressive malignancy and accounts for 20% of all head and neck cancer. However, the role of LOC554202 in human LSCC remains unknown. The expression level of LOC554202 and miR-31 was detected in the LSCC tiussues by using qRT-PCR. Cell growth was measured by CCK-8 assay. Flow cytometry and matrigel-coated membrane was used to detect for cell cycle and invasion respectively. We indicated that lncRNA LOC554202 expression was overexpressed in LSCC tissues compared with the paired adjacent samples and higher LOC554202 expression was associated with the advanced stage. In addition, we demonstrated that the expression level of miR-31 was downregulated in LSCC tissues compared to the paired adjacent samples and lower miR-31 expression was correlated with the advanced stage. Moreover, the expression of miR-31 was negatively correlated with the expression of LOC554202 in LSCC tissues. Ectopic expression of LOC554202 promoted LSCC cell growth, cell cyle and cell invasion and overexpression of miR-31 inhibited LSCC cell growth, cell cyle and cell invasion. Elevated expression of LOC554202 suppressed miR-31 expression and promoted RhoA expression in LSCC cell, which was a direct target gene of miR-31. Furthermore, LOC554202 increased LSCC cell growth, cell cyle and cell invasion through suppressing miR-31 expression. These results suggested that LOC554202 acted as an oncogene in the development of LSCC.",Journal of cellular biochemistry
9,"MiR-141-3p is upregulated in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and targets pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase-2, a negative regulator of the PI3K/AKT pathway.","The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway is frequently activated in various human cancers and plays essential roles in their development and progression. Accumulating evidence suggests that dysregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) is closely associated with cancer progression and metastasis. Here, we focused on miRNAs that could regulate genes related to the PI3K/AKT pathway in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). To identify upregulated miRNAs and their possible target genes in ESCC, we performed microarray-based integrative analyses of miRNA and mRNA expression levels in three human ESCC cell lines and a normal esophageal epithelial cell line. The miRNA microarray analysis revealed that miR-31-5p, miR-141-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-200c-3p, and miR-205-5p were expressed at higher levels in the ESCC cell lines than the normal esophageal epithelial cell line. Bioinformatical analyses of mRNA microarray data identified several AKT/PI3K pathway-related genes as candidate targets of these miRNAs, which include tumor suppressors such as DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 and pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase-2 (PHLPP2). To validate the targets of relevant miRNAs experimentally, synthetic mimics of the miRNAs were transfected into the esophageal epithelial cell line. Here, we report that miR-141-3p suppress the expression of PHLPP2, a negative regulators of the AKT/PI3K pathway, as a target in ESCC.",Biochemical and biophysical research communications
10,Downregulation of MiR-31 stimulates expression of LATS2 via the hippo pathway and promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Dysregulation of miRNAs is associated with cancer development by coordinately suppressing abundant target genes. Emerging evidence indicates that miR-31 plays a dual role in tumorigenicity. However, whether miR-31 plays as an oncogene in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the potential target molecules are still unclear. MiR-31 role in ESCC was investigated and an association of the target molecules with EMT was identified in the progression of ESCC. Methods: Western blot assays and qRT-PCR was performed to detect the protein and mRNA levels. We investigated the role of miR-31 in the regulation of LATS2 expression in ESCC cell lines via functional assays both in vivo and in vitro. The luciferase reporter assays was conducted to confirm LATS2 is a potential target of miR-31. Immunohistochemistry was used to measure LATS2 and TAZ expression in normal and ESCC tissue. Results: LATS2 is a component of the Hippo tumor-suppressive signaling pathway. Frequent loss of heterozygosity of LATS2 has been reported in esophageal cancer. We analyzed the reciprocal expression regulation of miR-31 and LATS2 and demonstrated that LATS2 expression was elevated by down-regulation of miR-31 at the post-transcriptional level in ESCC. Moreover, miR-31 significantly suppressed the luciferase activity of mRNA combined with the LATS2 3'-UTR, a key molecule in the Hippo pathway. Then, LATS2 consequently promoted the translocation of TAZ, which was examined using immunohistochemistry. Silencing of miR-31 significantly inhibited the cell proliferation, induced apoptosis and decreased the ability of migration/invasion in vitro. LATS2 impedes ESCC cell proliferation and invasion by suppressing miR-31, as well as mice xenograft model in vivo. Meanwhile, the nuclear localization of LATS2 constrained the phosphorylation of TAZ. Then, the expression level of TAZ was notably heightened with a high risk of recurrence compared to that observed in the low-risk patients, as well as, the higher expression associated with a poor survival. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that overexpression of miR-31 undertook an oncogenic role in ESCC by repressing expression of LATS2 via the Hippo Pathway and activating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. LATS2 and TAZ could be potential novel molecular markers for predicting the risk of recurrence and prognosis of ESCC.",Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR
11,MicroRNA miR-31 targets SIRT3 to disrupt mitochondrial activity and increase oxidative stress in oral carcinoma.,"MicroRNA miR-31 is implicated in the neoplastic process of various malignancies including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Silent information regulator 3 (Sirtuin3 or SIRT3) is a NAD-dependent deacetylase that regulates metabolic process. Suppressor role of SIRT3 has been found in neoplasms. This study investigates the disruptions of miR-31-SIRT3 cascade to explore their potential association with metabolic change in OSCC. We identified that miR-31 directly targeted SIRT3 in OSCC cells, and a reverse correlation between miR-31 expression and SIRT3 expression was noted in OSCC tumors. SIRT3 expression attenuated the miR-31 enhanced tumor cell migration and invasion. It also reduced the tumorigenic potential of FaDu cell line. miR-31-SIRT3 impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential and structural integrity. The dis-regulation of this axis also contributed to the genesis of oxidative stress. In addition, miR-31 switched tumor cells from aerobic metabolism to glycolytic metabolism. This study provides novel evidences demonstrating the presence of miR-31-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of SIRT3 in OSCC. The disruption of miR-31-SIRT3 cascade and the consequential metabolic aberrances are involved in OSCC progression.",Cancer letters

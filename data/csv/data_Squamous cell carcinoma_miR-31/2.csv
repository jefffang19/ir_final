0,Exploiting salivary miR-31 as a clinical biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Oral carcinoma is an important malignancy throughout the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional levels of targeted mRNAs. MiRNA-31(miR-31) is significantly upregulated in oral carcinoma tissues and plays oncogenic roles in oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the levels of miR-31 in saliva of patients with oral carcinoma (n = 45), oral verrucous leukoplakia (n = 10), and control healthy individuals (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Salivary miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors. However, our preliminary analysis showed no increase of salivary miR-31 in patients with oral verrucous leukoplakia relative to controls. The miR-31 was more abundant in saliva than in plasma, suggesting salivary miR-31 was a more sensitive marker for oral malignancy. After excision of oral carcinoma, salivary miR-31 was remarkably reduced, indicating that most of the upregulated salivary miR-31 came from tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results point to a potential application of salivary miR-31 as a biomarker for early detection and postoperative follow-up of oral carcinoma.",Head & neck
1,miR-31 targets ARID1A and enhances the oncogenicity and stemness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 is oncogenic for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Proteins containing the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID) modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcription machinery needed for gene expression. In this study, we showed that miR-31 was able to target ARID1A in HNSCC. HNSCC tumors had an inverse miR-31 and ARID1A expression. miR-31 associated oncogenicities were rescued by ARID1A expression in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ARID1A repressed the stemness properties and transcriptional activity of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM via the protein's affinity for AT-rich sites within promoters. HNSCC patients with tumors having high level of miR-31 expression and high levels of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM expression, together with low level of ARID1A expression, were found to have the worst survival. This study provides novel mechanistic clues demonstrating that miR-31 inhibits ARID1A and that this enriches the oncogenicity and stemness of HNSCC.",Oncotarget
2,MiR-31-5p-ACOX1 Axis Enhances Tumorigenic Fitness in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Via the Promigratory Prostaglandin E2.,"During neoplastic development, a multitude of changes in genome-encoded information are progressively selected to confer growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. microRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks, given their role as a critical layer of robust gene expression control, are frequently altered in neoplasm. However, whether and how these gene perturbations impact metabolic homeostasis remains largely unresolved. Methods: Through targeted miRNA expression screening, we uncovered an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-associated miRNAome, among which miR-31-5p was identified based on extent of up-regulation, functional impact on OSCC cell migration and invasion, and direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal β-oxidation, ACOX1. Results: We further found that both miR-31-5p and ACOX1 underpin, in an antagonistic manner, the overall cellular lipidome profiles as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC cells. Interestingly, the extracellular levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate of ACOX1, were controlled by the miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis, and were shown to positively influence the extent of cell motility in correlation with metastatic status. The promigratory effect of this metabolite was mediated by an elevation in EP1-ERK-MMP9 signaling. Of note, functional significance of this regulatory pathway was further corroborated by its clinicopathologically-correlated expression in OSCC patient specimens. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings outlined a model whereby misregulated miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis in tumor alters lipid metabolomes, consequently eliciting an intracellular signaling change to enhance cell motility. Our clinical analysis also unveiled PGE2 as a viable salivary biomarker for prognosticating oral cancer progression, further underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis.",Theranostics
3,Abrogation of esophageal carcinoma development in miR-31 knockout rats.,"MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) is overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a deadly disease associated with dietary Zn deficiency and inflammation. In a Zn deficiency-promoted rat ESCC model with miR-31 up-regulation, cancer-associated inflammation, and a high ESCC burden following N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA) exposure, systemic antimiR-31 delivery reduced ESCC incidence from 85 to 45% (P = 0.038) and miR-31 gene knockout abrogated development of ESCC (P = 1 × 10-6). Transcriptomics, genome sequencing, and metabolomics analyses in these Zn-deficient rats revealed the molecular basis of ESCC abrogation by miR-31 knockout. Our identification of EGLN3, a known negative regulator of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), as a direct target of miR-31 establishes a functional link between oncomiR-31, tumor suppressor target EGLN3, and up-regulated NF-κB-controlled inflammation signaling. Interaction among oncogenic miR-31, EGLN3 down-regulation, and inflammation was also documented in human ESCCs. miR-31 deletion resulted in suppression of miR-31-associated EGLN3/NF-κB-controlled inflammatory pathways. ESCC-free, Zn-deficient miR-31-/- rat esophagus displayed no genome instability and limited metabolic activity changes vs. the pronounced mutational burden and ESCC-associated metabolic changes of Zn-deficient wild-type rats. These results provide conclusive evidence that miR-31 expression is necessary for ESCC development.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America
4,Identification of microRNAs as novel biomarkers for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma: a study based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and bioinformatics.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have played important roles in the regulation of gene expression in many cancers, but their roles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) are still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the potential ESCC-specific key miRNAs from a large sample dataset in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Methods: Integrative bioinformatics analysis was used to identify key ESCC-specific miRNAs related to the ESCC patients' tumor histological grade and lymphatic metastasis from TCGA. Next, these key miRNA potential gene regulatory functions and relationships with ESCC patients' clinical characteristics and overall survival were analyzed. Finally, three key miRNAs were selected randomly and quantificational real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to validate in 51 newly diagnosed ESCC patients' tissues samples (collected from Nov. 2017 to Feb. 2019, in Wuwei, China) whether the bioinformatics analyses results were reliable and valid. Two-tailed Student's t test, Pearson Chi-squared test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used in this study. Results: Thirty-five ESCC-specific miRNAs from TCGA database were investigated (fold-change > 2.0, P < 0.05), and 28 participated in the miRNAs-mRNAs co-expression network construction, while 17 were related with ESCC patients' tumor histological grade, TNM stage, and lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, six miRNAs (including miR-200b-3p, miR-31-5p, miR-15b-5p, miR-141-3p, miR-135b-5p, and miR-195-5p) were correlated with overall survival of ESCC patients (log-rank, P < 0.05). MiR-135b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-195-5p were selected for verification of the expression levels in 51 ESCC patients' tissue samples by using qRT-PCR. We found that the fold-changes between qRT-PCR and TCGA were completely consistent. The results also suggested that miR-135b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-195-5p were significantly correlated with tumor differentiation degrees (P < 0.05), miR-195-5p was significantly correlated with tumor TNM stage (P < 0.05), and miR-135b-5p was significantly correlated with lymph-node metastasis (P < 0.05). MiR-135b-5p, miR-15b-5p, and miR-195-5p expression levels, ESCC patient clinical features association analysis results and the aforementioned TCGA bioinformatics analyses were similar. Conclusion: This study identified key ESCC-related miRNAs. The key miRNAs are worthy of further investigation as potential novel biomarkers for diagnosis, classification, and prognosis of ESCC.",Chinese medical journal
5,Targeting of miR-31/96/182 to the Numb gene during head and neck oncogenesis.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). This study investigates whether miR-31, miR-96, and miR-182 are involved in targeting Numb during HNSCC. Methods: The expression of miR-31/96/182 in tumor tissues was analyzed. Reporter assay, knockdown, expression, and oncogenic analysis were carried out in cell lines. Results: Upregulation of miR-31/96/182 was detected in tumor tissues. In addition, advanced tumors showed higher expression levels of these miRNAs. The expression of these miRNAs was upregulated after treatment with areca ingredients (P < .01 or P < .001). These miRNAs directly targeted the 3' untranslated region (UTR) sequence of the Numb gene. An increased migration and invasion of HNSCC cells was associated with the exogenous expression of miR-31/96/182 (P < .01 or P < .001), and this was reverted by expression of Numb. Conclusion: This study provides new evidence demonstrating that there is frequent and concordant upregulation of miR-31, miR-96, and miR-182 during HNSCC and these miRNAs co-target Numb.",Head & neck
6,Small RNAs in metastatic and non-metastatic oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Small non-coding regulatory RNAs control cellular functions at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is among the leading cancers in the world and the presence of cervical lymph node metastases is currently its strongest prognostic factor. In this work we aimed at finding small RNAs expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma that could be associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis. Methods: Small RNA libraries from metastatic and non-metastatic oral squamous cell carcinomas were sequenced for the identification and quantification of known small RNAs. Selected markers were validated in plasma samples. Additionally, we used in silico analysis to investigate possible new molecules, not previously described, involved in the metastatic process. Results: Global expression patterns were not associated with cervical metastases. MiR-21, miR-203 and miR-205 were highly expressed throughout samples, in agreement with their role in epithelial cell biology, but disagreeing with studies correlating these molecules with cancer invasion. Eighteen microRNAs, but no other small RNA class, varied consistently between metastatic and non-metastatic samples. Nine of these microRNAs had been previously detected in human plasma, eight of which presented consistent results between tissue and plasma samples. MiR-31 and miR-130b, known to inhibit several steps in the metastatic process, were over-expressed in non-metastatic samples and the expression of miR-130b was confirmed in plasma of patients showing no metastasis. MiR-181 and miR-296 were detected in metastatic tumors and the expression of miR-296 was confirmed in plasma of patients presenting metastasis. A novel microRNA-like molecule was also associated with non-metastatic samples, potentially targeting cell-signaling mechanisms. Conclusions: We corroborate literature data on the role of small RNAs in cancer metastasis and suggest the detection of microRNAs as a tool that may assist in the evaluation of oral squamous cell carcinoma metastatic potential.",BMC medical genomics
7,MicroRNA-31 functions as an oncogenic microRNA in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cells by targeting RhoTBT1.,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a malignancy of epidermal keratinocytes that is responsible for ~20% of annual skin cancer-associated mortalities. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that the dysregulation of micro (mi)RNAs serves a significant role in the tumorigenesis and progression of human cSCC. MicroRNA-31 (miR-31) is upregulated in cSCC and is involved in cSCC development. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. The present study demonstrated that miR-31 is upregulated in the cSCC cell line, A-431, and that miR-31 expression contributes to the cell proliferation and invasion of cSCC. In addition, bioinformatics combined with dual luciferase reporter analysis was applied to determine that the tumor suppressor RhoTBT1 was a direct target of miR-31. In addition, miR-31 mimics reduced RhoBTB1 expression in A-431 cells. The results of MTT and Transwell assays demonstrated that knockdown of RhoBTB1 by short interfering RNA induced cell proliferation and invasion in A-431 cells. These results indicated that suppression of RhoBTB1 may be involved in cSCC tumorigenesis, which was directly affected by miR-31. In conclusion, the present study provides evidence that miR-31 acts as an oncogene through direct repression of RhoTBT1 expression in cSCC cancer, suggesting a potential application of miR-31 in prognosis prediction and its therapeutic application in cSCC.",Oncology letters
8,"Novel insights into laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma from association study of aberrantly expressed miRNAs, lncRNAs and clinical features in Bulgarian patients.","Purpose: Laryngeal cancer is one of most common and aggressive head and neck cancers with poor prognosis and great necessity for improvement of treatment modalities. MicroRNAs (miRs) are among the most investigated molecules recently due to their potential as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in cancer. The purpose of our study was to explore the association of certain clinicopathological features with the expression levels of some known cancer associated non-coding (nc) RNAs: miR-21 and miR-31 in both of their isoforms, miR-145-5p, miR-55-5p, miR-196a-5p, miR-210-3p, miR-221-3p, miR-222-3p, miR-424-5p, lncRNA MALAT1 and lncRNA HOTAIR. Methods: Expression levels of the chosen markers were investigated in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and normal samples in 82 Bulgarian patients via RT-qPCR, and the results were analyzed with SPSS v23.0 statistical software. Results: All of the explored ncRNAs were significantly deregulated in LSCC samples, suggesting their involvement in laryngeal carcinogenesis. New significant association were found between the expression levels of miR-21-5p, miR-222-3p, HOTAIR and family history. Moreover, miR-424-5p showed potential as marker for subglottic LSCC location, and ""passenger"" miR-31-3p was significantly upregulated in well and moderately differentiated LSCC. Conclusion: Our results enrich the knowledge about ncRNA involvement in LSCC tumorigenesis. Further studies are needed to evaluate the clinical utility of the differently expressed ncRNAs as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in LSCC.",Journal of B.U.ON. : official journal of the Balkan Union of Oncology
9,Dysregulation of miR-31 and miR-375 expression is associated with clinical outcomes in oral carcinoma.,"Objectives: To identify differentially expressed miRNA between oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and non-cancer (NC) and to associate these with clinico-pathological parameters. Materials and methods: miRNA microarray profiling was utilized to obtain the expression profile of miRNAs in four OSCC and four NC samples. The expression of miR-31 and miR-375 was further validated in 26 OSCC and three NC samples using real-time-PCR. The association between miRNA expression and clinico-pathological parameters was tested by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: Microarray profiling demonstrated that 15 and four miRNAs were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in OSCC as compared with NC. miR-31 and miR-375 were validated as up- and down-regulated miRNAs, respectively. In univariate analyses, expression of miR-31 was significantly elevated in early stage, tumours with no metastatic nodes and those from the buccal mucosa. By contrast, low miR-375 expression was significantly associated with late stage disease, larger tumour size and the non-cohesive type of pattern of invasion in OSCC. The association between miR-31 expression with tumour staging and site and miR-375 with tumour staging remained significant in multivariate analyses. Conclusions: This study has identified 19 miRNAs significantly associated with OSCC, and expressions of miR-31 and miR-375 were significantly related with clinico-pathological parameters suggesting they could be important in driving oral tumourigenesis.",Oral diseases
10,Serum expression of selected miRNAs in patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC).,"Background: The aim of the present study was to identify specific serum miRNAs (preoperative serum samples compared to healthy controls) as potential diagnostic markers for detection in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC). Serum samples obtained from 66 patients with LSCC were compared with 100 healthy control subjects. Additionally, miRNA levels were evaluated to identify possible correlations with clinicopathological features. Methods: The expression of 377 miRNAs (screening set) was evaluated by microarray screening. The most differentially expressed miRNAs were validated by high-throughput real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in the group of LSCC patients and healthy controls. Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the highly and significantly identified deregulated miRNA(s) as potential candidate biomarker(s). Results: According to the array analysis, eleven miRNAs revealed an altered expression profile. The levels of serum expression of miR-31, miR-141, miR-149a, miR-182, LET-7a, miR-4853p, miR-122 and miR-33 were up-regulated, and those of miR-145, miR-223 and miR-133a down-regulated, in the LSCC group compared to healthy controls. ROC curve analyses revealed an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 1.00 (95%Cl: 0.999-1.00; P < 0.001) for miR-31 and LET-7a, 1.00 (95%Cl: 1.00-1.00; P < 0.001) for miR-33 respectively, indicating that these three miRNAs had an additive effect regarding diagnostic value. No statistically significant differences were found between the serum levels of these eleven miRNAs and the tested clinicopathological features. Conclusion: Our findings outline a distinct miRNA expression profile in laryngeal cancer (LC) cases which can be used to diagnose LSCC patients with high sensitivity and specificity. Particular miRNA signatures (miR-31, LET-7a and miR-33) may be considered as novel, non-invasive biomarkers for LC diagnosis. Trial registration: Registration number: RNN/203/13/KE.

11,Role of non-coding RNAs in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma: A narrative review.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide with high recurrence, metastasis, and poor treatment outcome. Recent studies have reported that non-coding RNA (ncRNA) might play critical role in regulating different types of cancer. MicroRNAs (miRs) are short ncRNAs (20-25 nucleotides) responsible for post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and may have a role in oncogenesis by acting as oncomiRs or tumor suppressor miRs. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are heterogenous group of ncRNAs more than 200 nucleotides long, can act in cis and/or in trans, and have been also implicated in carcinogenesis. These molecules have been suggested to be promising candidates as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and for development of novel therapeutic approaches. In this review, we have summarized recent findings on role of these ncRNAs in HPV-negative (HPV-ve) and HPV-positive (HPV+ve) HNSCC. The available literature supports differential expression of both microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs, which include oncogenic ncRNAs (miR-21, miR-31, miR-155, miR-211, HOTAIR, and MALAT1) and tumor suppressor ncRNAs (let7d, miR-17, miR-375, miR-139, and MEG3) in HPV+ve HNSCC tumors as compared to HPV-ve tumors and they have distinct role in the pathophysiology of these two types of HNSCCs.",Oral diseases
12,Similar Squamous Cell Carcinoma Epithelium microRNA Expression in Never Smokers and Ever Smokers.,"The incidence of oral tumors in patients who never used mutagenic agents such as tobacco is increasing. In an effort to better understand these tumors we studied microRNA (miRNA) expression in tumor epithelium of never tobacco users, tumor epithelium of ever tobacco users, and nonpathological control oral epithelium. A comparison of levels among 372 miRNAs in 12 never tobacco users with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) versus 10 healthy controls was made using the reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A similar analysis was done with 8 ever tobacco users with OSCC. These comparisons revealed miR-10b-5p, miR-196a-5p, and miR-31-5p as enriched in the tumor epithelium in OSCC of both never and ever tobacco users. Examination of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project miRNA data on 305 OSCCs and 30 controls revealed 100% of those miRNAs enriched in never smoker OSCCs in this patient group were also enriched in ever smoker OSCCs. Nonsupervised clustering of TCGA OSCCs was suggestive of two or four subgroups of tumors based on miRNA levels with limited evidence for differences in tobacco exposure among the groups. Results from both patient groups together stress the importance of miR196a-5p in OSCC malignancy in both never and ever smokers, and emphasize the overall similarity of miRNA expression in OSCCs in these two risk groups. It implies that there may be great similarity in etiology of OSCC in never and ever smokers and that classifying OSCC based on tobacco exposure may not be helpful in the clinic.",PloS one

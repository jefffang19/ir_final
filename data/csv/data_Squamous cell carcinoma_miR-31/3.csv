0,Exploiting salivary miR-31 as a clinical biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Oral carcinoma is an important malignancy throughout the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional levels of targeted mRNAs. MiRNA-31(miR-31) is significantly upregulated in oral carcinoma tissues and plays oncogenic roles in oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the levels of miR-31 in saliva of patients with oral carcinoma (n = 45), oral verrucous leukoplakia (n = 10), and control healthy individuals (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Salivary miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors. However, our preliminary analysis showed no increase of salivary miR-31 in patients with oral verrucous leukoplakia relative to controls. The miR-31 was more abundant in saliva than in plasma, suggesting salivary miR-31 was a more sensitive marker for oral malignancy. After excision of oral carcinoma, salivary miR-31 was remarkably reduced, indicating that most of the upregulated salivary miR-31 came from tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results point to a potential application of salivary miR-31 as a biomarker for early detection and postoperative follow-up of oral carcinoma.",Head & neck
1,miR-31 targets ARID1A and enhances the oncogenicity and stemness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 is oncogenic for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Proteins containing the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID) modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcription machinery needed for gene expression. In this study, we showed that miR-31 was able to target ARID1A in HNSCC. HNSCC tumors had an inverse miR-31 and ARID1A expression. miR-31 associated oncogenicities were rescued by ARID1A expression in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ARID1A repressed the stemness properties and transcriptional activity of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM via the protein's affinity for AT-rich sites within promoters. HNSCC patients with tumors having high level of miR-31 expression and high levels of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM expression, together with low level of ARID1A expression, were found to have the worst survival. This study provides novel mechanistic clues demonstrating that miR-31 inhibits ARID1A and that this enriches the oncogenicity and stemness of HNSCC.",Oncotarget
2,MiR-31-5p-ACOX1 Axis Enhances Tumorigenic Fitness in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Via the Promigratory Prostaglandin E2.,"During neoplastic development, a multitude of changes in genome-encoded information are progressively selected to confer growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. microRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks, given their role as a critical layer of robust gene expression control, are frequently altered in neoplasm. However, whether and how these gene perturbations impact metabolic homeostasis remains largely unresolved. Methods: Through targeted miRNA expression screening, we uncovered an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-associated miRNAome, among which miR-31-5p was identified based on extent of up-regulation, functional impact on OSCC cell migration and invasion, and direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal β-oxidation, ACOX1. Results: We further found that both miR-31-5p and ACOX1 underpin, in an antagonistic manner, the overall cellular lipidome profiles as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC cells. Interestingly, the extracellular levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate of ACOX1, were controlled by the miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis, and were shown to positively influence the extent of cell motility in correlation with metastatic status. The promigratory effect of this metabolite was mediated by an elevation in EP1-ERK-MMP9 signaling. Of note, functional significance of this regulatory pathway was further corroborated by its clinicopathologically-correlated expression in OSCC patient specimens. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings outlined a model whereby misregulated miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis in tumor alters lipid metabolomes, consequently eliciting an intracellular signaling change to enhance cell motility. Our clinical analysis also unveiled PGE2 as a viable salivary biomarker for prognosticating oral cancer progression, further underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis.",Theranostics

4,MicroRNA-31 is overexpressed in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and regulates cell motility and colony formation ability of tumor cells.,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is a malignancy of epidermal keratinocytes that is responsible for approximately 20% of skin cancer-related death yearly. We have previously compared the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of cSCC to healthy skin and found the dysregulation of miRNAs in human cSCC. In this study we show that miR-31 is overexpressed in cSCC (n = 68) compared to healthy skin (n = 34) and precancerous skin lesions (actinic keratosis, n = 12). LNA in situ hybridization revealed that miR-31 was specifically up-regulated in tumor cells. Mechanistic studies of inhibition of endogenous miR-31 in human metastatic cSCC cells revealed suppressed migration, invasion and colony forming ability, whereas overexpression of miR-31 induced these phenotypes. These results indicate that miR-31 regulates cancer-associated phenotypes of cSCC and identify miR-31 as a potential target for cSCC treatment.",PloS one
5,Repression of Esophageal Neoplasia and Inflammatory Signaling by Anti-miR-31 Delivery In Vivo.,"Background: Overexpression of microRNA-31 (miR-31) is implicated in the pathogenesis of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), a deadly disease associated with dietary zinc deficiency. Using a rat model that recapitulates features of human ESCC, the mechanism whereby Zn regulates miR-31 expression to promote ESCC is examined. Methods: To inhibit in vivo esophageal miR-31 overexpression in Zn-deficient rats (n = 12-20 per group), locked nucleic acid-modified anti-miR-31 oligonucleotides were administered over five weeks. miR-31 expression was determined by northern blotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and in situ hybridization. Physiological miR-31 targets were identified by microarray analysis and verified by luciferase reporter assay. Cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and expression of inflammation genes were determined by immunoblotting, caspase assays, and immunohistochemistry. The miR-31 promoter in Zn-deficient esophagus was identified by ChIP-seq using an antibody for histone mark H3K4me3. Data were analyzed with t test and analysis of variance. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: In vivo, anti-miR-31 reduced miR-31 overexpression (P = .002) and suppressed the esophageal preneoplasia in Zn-deficient rats. At the same time, the miR-31 target Stk40 was derepressed, thereby inhibiting the STK40-NF-κΒ-controlled inflammatory pathway, with resultant decreased cellular proliferation and activated apoptosis (caspase 3/7 activities, fold change = 10.7, P = .005). This same connection between miR-31 overexpression and STK40/NF-κΒ expression was also documented in human ESCC cell lines. In Zn-deficient esophagus, the miR-31 promoter region and NF-κΒ binding site were activated. Zn replenishment restored the regulation of this genomic region and a normal esophageal phenotype. Conclusions: The data define the in vivo signaling pathway underlying interaction of Zn deficiency and miR-31 overexpression in esophageal neoplasia and provide a mechanistic rationale for miR-31 as a therapeutic target for ESCC.",Journal of the National Cancer Institute
6,Predicting the Presence of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Using Commonly Dysregulated MicroRNA in Oral Swirls.,"Oral swirls are a noninvasive, rapidly collected source of salivary microRNA (miRNA) potentially useful in the early detection of disease states, particularly oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The aim of this study was to predict the presence of OSCC using a panel of OSCC-related dysregulated miRNA found in oral swirls, identified jointly in data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) and fresh-frozen specimens. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to determine miRNA fold changes in FFPE OSCC specimens relative to histologically normal epithelium. These data were placed with NGS of fresh-frozen tissue data of The Cancer Genome Atlas database to select a panel of commonly dysregulated miRNA. This panel was then analyzed by RT-qPCR in RNA extracted from oral swirls collected from 30 patients with OSCC and 30 controls. Upregulation of miR-31 and miR-21 and downregulation of miR-99a, let-7c, miR-125b, and miR-100 were found between OSCC and controls in both FFPE and fresh-frozen samples. These miRNAs were studied in a training set of 15 OSCC versus 15 control oral swirls to develop a dysregulation score [AUC, 0.95; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.88-1.03] and classification tree. A test cohort of 15 OSCC versus 15 control oral swirls yielded a dysregulation score AUC of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.79-1.00) with the classification tree identifying 100% (15/15) of OSCC and 67% (10/15) of controls. This study debuts the use of OSCC-associated miRNA, commonly dysregulated in both FFPE and frozen specimens, in oral swirls to indicate the presence of OSCC with high accuracy.

7,K14-EGFP-miR-31 transgenic mice have high susceptibility to chemical-induced squamous cell tumorigenesis that is associating with Ku80 repression.,"Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) occurring in the head and neck region and the esophagus causes tremendous cancer mortality around the world. miR-31 is among the most eminently upregulated MicroRNAs in SCC, when it occurs in the head and neck region and the esophagus. We established miR-31 transgenic mouse lines, in which miR-31 is under the control of the K14 promoter. 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) is a mutagen that causes double strand breaks. The transgenic mice exhibited a higher potential for tumor induction than wild-type (Wt) mice of the tongue and esophagus after 4NQO treatment. After 4NQO treatment or irradiation, p-γH2AX expression in squamous epithelium of transgenic mice was increased more than in Wt mice. Exogenous expression of miR-31 was also found to be associated with the higher p-γH2AX expression induced by 4NQO in human oral SCC (OSCC) cell lines. The repair genes PARP1 and Ku80 were validated as new targets of miR-31 in human OSCC cell lines, and were found to be downregulated in the squamous epithelium of the tongue in transgenic mice. However, only the downregulation of Ku80 was essential for maintaining the high level of p-γH2AX induced by 4NQO in OSCC cells. Inverse expression profiles for miR-31 and Ku80 were noted in human OSCC tissue. Our study identifies the high sensitivity of K14-EGFP-miR-31 transgenic mice to chemical carcinogen-induced squamous cell tumorigenesis and shows that this seems to be associated with the downregulation of Ku80 and an impairment of repair activity in squamous cells, which are mediated by miR-31.",International journal of cancer
8,Integrated Analysis and MicroRNA Expression Profiling Identified Seven miRNAs Associated With Progression of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"MicroRNAs have been used as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for many cancers including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Several studies have been shown that microRNA (miRNA) play important roles during the progression of OSCC. However, the results vary largely in different studies due to different platforms and sample sizes. In this study, we systematically evaluated a large scale of miRNA profiles from current qualified OSCC samples, and further investigated the functions of genes regulated by these key miRNAs as well as the signaling pathways through which these miRNA effect carcinogenesis. Seven key miRNAs were identified, and of which three were significantly upregulated, including hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-338, and four were downregulated, namely hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-133a, hsa-miR-133b, and hsa-miR-139. The function enrichment analysis revealed that target genes of upregulated miRNAs were associated with cellular protein metabolic process, macromolecule metabolic process, and TGF-beta pathway, while the targets of downregulated were enriched in negative regulation of macromolecule biosynthetic process and gene expression, and p53, long-term potentiation and adherens junction pathways. Transcription factor analysis revealed that there were 67 (51.1%) transcription factors influenced by both up and downregulated miRNAs. In summary, seven key miRNAs were found to play essential role in progression of OSCC, as well as the target genes and transcription factors of these miRNAs. The potential functions of these target genes identified in our study may be profitable to diagnosis and prognostic prediction of OSCC as biomarkers. J. Cell.

9,Dysregulation of miR-31 and miR-21 induced by zinc deficiency promotes esophageal cancer.,"Zinc deficiency (ZD) increases the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In a rat model, chronic ZD induces an inflammatory gene signature that fuels ESCC development. microRNAs regulate gene expression and are aberrantly expressed in cancers. Here we investigated whether chronic ZD (23 weeks) also induces a protumorigenic microRNA signature. Using the nanoString technology, we evaluated microRNA profiles in ZD esophagus and six additional tissues (skin, lung, pancreas, liver, prostate and peripheral blood mononuclear cells [PBMC]). ZD caused overexpression of inflammation genes and altered microRNA expression across all tissues analyzed, predictive of disease development. Importantly, the inflammatory ZD esophagus had a distinct microRNA signature resembling human ESCC or tongue SCC miRNAomes with miR-31 and miR-21 as the top-up-regulated species. Circulating miR-31 was also the top-up-regulated species in PBMCs. In ZD esophagus and tongue, oncogenic miR-31 and miR-21 overexpression was accompanied by down-regulation of their respective tumor-suppressor targets PPP2R2A and PDCD4. Importantly, esophageal miR-31 and miR-21 levels were directly associated with the appearance of ESCC in ZD rats, as compared with their cancer-free Zn-sufficient or Zn-replenished counterparts. In situ hybridization analysis in rat and human tongue SCCs localized miR-31 to tumor cells and miR-21 to stromal cells. In regressing tongue SCCs from Zn-supplemented rats, miR-31 and miR-21 expression was concomitantly reduced, establishing their responsiveness to Zn therapy. A search for putative microRNA targets revealed a bias toward genes in inflammatory pathways. Our finding that ZD causes miR-31 and miR-21 dysregulation associated with inflammation provides insight into mechanisms whereby ZD promotes ESCC.",Carcinogenesis
10,MiR-21 overexpression in human primary squamous cell lung carcinoma is associated with poor patient prognosis.,"Purpose: This study compared miRNA expression patterns in primary squamous cell lung carcinoma specimens with those of matched normal lung tissue in order to determine their potential relevance to clinicopathological factors and patient postoperative survival times. Methods: Locked nucleic acids miRNA microarray expression profiling was performed on four matched pairs of tissues. After microarray validation by quantitative real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assays (qRT-PCR) (real-time PCR), miR-21 was selected for further TaqMan real-time PCR study in 30 matched tissue pairs. Results: Seven miRNAs of hsa-miR-21, hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-34a, hsa-miR-22*, hsa-miR-504, hsa-miR-18a, and hsa-miR-412 were observed to be upregulated greater than twofold in the squamous cell lung carcinoma tissues compared with normal tissues, whereas 23 miRNAs of hsa-miR-30a, hsa-miR-30d, hsa-miR-126, hsa-miR-652, hsa-miR-100, hsa-miR-143, hsa-miR-130a, hsa-miR-145, hsa-miR-30e, hsa-miR-126*, hsa-miR-181a, hsa-miR-125b, hsa-miR-886-3p, hsa-miR-451, hsa-miR-29c, hsa-miR-26b, hsa-miR-101, hsa-miR-320, hsa-miR-30b, hsa-miR-886-5p, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-26a, and hsa-miR-99a were found to be downregulated greater than twofold. MiR-21 was overexpressed in 73.3% of the squamous cell lung carcinoma specimens examined (P = 0.022). The relationship between the miR-21 expression level and various clinicopathologic factors was also analyzed. High-level expression of miR-21 was significantly correlated with shortened survival time (P = 0.022, log-rank test; Kaplan-Meier). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis revealed this significant prognostic impact (P = 0.000; HR 1.293; 95% CI 1.123-1.489) to be independent of clinical disease stage (P = 0.013; HR 2.660; 95% CI 1.229-5.758) and other clinicopathologic factors. Conclusions: Expression patterns of miRNAs were found to be systematically altered in squamous cell lung carcinoma tissue. High miR-21 expression is associated with shortened survival time, indicating that miR-21 may serve as a molecular diagnostic and prognostic marker for patients with squamous cell lung carcinoma.",Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology
11,A 5-microRNA signature for lung squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis and hsa-miR-31 for prognosis.,"Purpose: Recent studies have suggested that microRNA biomarkers could be useful for stratifying lung cancer subtypes, but microRNA signatures varied between different populations. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is one major subtype of lung cancer that urgently needs biomarkers to aid patient management. Here, we undertook the first comprehensive investigation on microRNA in Chinese SCC patients. Experimental design: MicroRNA expression was measured in cancerous and noncancerous tissue pairs strictly collected from Chinese SCC patients (stages I-III), who had not been treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to surgery. The molecular targets of proposed microRNA were further examined. Results: We identified a 5-microRNA classifier (hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-182, hsa-miR-486-5p, hsa-miR-30a, and hsa-miR-140-3p) that could distinguish SCC from normal lung tissues. The classifier had an accuracy of 94.1% in a training cohort (34 patients) and 96.2% in a test cohort (26 patients). We also showed that high expression of hsa-miR-31 was associated with poor survival in these 60 SCC patients by Kaplan-Meier analysis (P = 0.007), by univariate Cox analysis (P = 0.011), and by multivariate Cox analysis (P = 0.011). This association was independently validated in a separate cohort of 88 SCC patients (P = 0.008, 0.011, and 0.003 in Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariate Cox analysis, and multivariate Cox analysis, respectively). We then determined that the tumor suppressor DICER1 is a target of hsa-miR-31. Expression of hsa-miR-31 in a human lung cancer cell line repressed DICER1 activity but not PPP2R2A or LATS2. Conclusions: Our results identified a new diagnostic microRNA classifier for SCC among Chinese patients and a new prognostic biomarker, hsa-miR-31.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
12,Prediction of radiotherapy response with a 5-microRNA signature-based nomogram in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Radiotherapy is unlikely to benefit all patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Therefore, novel method is warranted to predict the radiotherapy response. Our study aimed to construct a microRNA (miRNA)-based nomogram to predict clinical outcomes of patients with HNSCC receiving radiotherapy. We screened out 56 differential miRNAs by analyzing 44 paired tumor and adjacent normal samples miRNA expression profiles from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). A total of 307 patients with HNSCC receiving adjuvant radiotherapy were randomly divided into a training set (n = 154) and a validation set (n = 153). In the training set, we combined the differential miRNA profiles with clinical outcomes, and LASSO regression model was applied to establish a 5-miRNA signature. The prediction accuracy of the 5-miRNA signature was further validated. In addition, target genes of these miRNAs were predicted, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis as well as KEGG pathway analysis was executed. A 5-miRNA signature including miR-99a, miR-31, miR-410, miR-424, and miR-495 was identified. With a cutoff value of 1.2201 from Youden's index, the training set was divided into high-risk and low-risk groups, and the 5-year overall survival was significantly different (30% vs. 73%, HR 3.65, CI 2.46-8.16; P < 0.0001). Furthermore, our 5-miRNA signature revealed that only low-risk group would benefit from radiotherapy. Then, a nomogram combining 5-miRNA signature with clinical variables to predict radiotherapy response was constructed. The analysis of 108 target genes of these miRNAs revealed some potential mechanisms in HNSCC radiotherapy response for future investigations. In conclusion, the 5-miRNA signature-based nomogram is useful in predicting radiotherapy response in HNSCC and might become a promising tool to optimize radiation strategies.",Cancer medicine

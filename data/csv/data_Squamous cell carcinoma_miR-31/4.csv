0,Exploiting salivary miR-31 as a clinical biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Oral carcinoma is an important malignancy throughout the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional levels of targeted mRNAs. MiRNA-31(miR-31) is significantly upregulated in oral carcinoma tissues and plays oncogenic roles in oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the levels of miR-31 in saliva of patients with oral carcinoma (n = 45), oral verrucous leukoplakia (n = 10), and control healthy individuals (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Salivary miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors. However, our preliminary analysis showed no increase of salivary miR-31 in patients with oral verrucous leukoplakia relative to controls. The miR-31 was more abundant in saliva than in plasma, suggesting salivary miR-31 was a more sensitive marker for oral malignancy. After excision of oral carcinoma, salivary miR-31 was remarkably reduced, indicating that most of the upregulated salivary miR-31 came from tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results point to a potential application of salivary miR-31 as a biomarker for early detection and postoperative follow-up of oral carcinoma.",Head & neck
1,miR-31 targets ARID1A and enhances the oncogenicity and stemness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 is oncogenic for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Proteins containing the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID) modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcription machinery needed for gene expression. In this study, we showed that miR-31 was able to target ARID1A in HNSCC. HNSCC tumors had an inverse miR-31 and ARID1A expression. miR-31 associated oncogenicities were rescued by ARID1A expression in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ARID1A repressed the stemness properties and transcriptional activity of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM via the protein's affinity for AT-rich sites within promoters. HNSCC patients with tumors having high level of miR-31 expression and high levels of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM expression, together with low level of ARID1A expression, were found to have the worst survival. This study provides novel mechanistic clues demonstrating that miR-31 inhibits ARID1A and that this enriches the oncogenicity and stemness of HNSCC.",Oncotarget
2,MiR-31-5p-ACOX1 Axis Enhances Tumorigenic Fitness in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Via the Promigratory Prostaglandin E2.,"During neoplastic development, a multitude of changes in genome-encoded information are progressively selected to confer growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. microRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks, given their role as a critical layer of robust gene expression control, are frequently altered in neoplasm. However, whether and how these gene perturbations impact metabolic homeostasis remains largely unresolved. Methods: Through targeted miRNA expression screening, we uncovered an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-associated miRNAome, among which miR-31-5p was identified based on extent of up-regulation, functional impact on OSCC cell migration and invasion, and direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal Î²-oxidation, ACOX1. Results: We further found that both miR-31-5p and ACOX1 underpin, in an antagonistic manner, the overall cellular lipidome profiles as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC cells. Interestingly, the extracellular levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate of ACOX1, were controlled by the miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis, and were shown to positively influence the extent of cell motility in correlation with metastatic status. The promigratory effect of this metabolite was mediated by an elevation in EP1-ERK-MMP9 signaling. Of note, functional significance of this regulatory pathway was further corroborated by its clinicopathologically-correlated expression in OSCC patient specimens. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings outlined a model whereby misregulated miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis in tumor alters lipid metabolomes, consequently eliciting an intracellular signaling change to enhance cell motility. Our clinical analysis also unveiled PGE2 as a viable salivary biomarker for prognosticating oral cancer progression, further underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis.",Theranostics
3,miR-31 is upregulated in oral premalignant epithelium and contributes to the immortalization of normal oral keratinocytes.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent malignancy worldwide. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and are crucial for tumorigenesis. Previously, we have identified that miR-31 is frequently upregulated in OSCC and that this miR-31 increase, together with downstream effector modulation, enhances oral carcinogenesis. We have identified higher levels of miR-31 expression in oral potential malignant disorder (OPMD) tissues compared with normal oral mucosa. Exogenous miR-31 and human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) expression were introduced into cultured normal oral keratinocytes (NOKs), which led to the immortalization; these lines were designated M31OK1 and M31OK3. These immortalized lines maintained the capability to undergo squamous differentiation. In addition, migration by both cell lines was attenuated by hTERT and miR-31 knockdown. M31OK1 carries a p53 gene mutation at codon 273. A serum-tolerant subline, M31OK1-D, exhibits potent anchorage-independent growth that is attenuated by knockdown of both hTERT and miR-31. miR-31-targeted factors inhibiting HIF (FIH), which upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), was found crucial for oral tumorigenesis. The proliferation, migration and epithelial-mesenchymal transition of M31OK1-D are associated with downregulation of FIH and upregulation of VEGF, which require miR-31 expression. High miR-31 expression is correlated with higher VEGF expression and lower E-cadherin expression in OPMD tissue. It can be concluded that miR-31 collaborates with hTERT to immortalize NOKs and that this may contribute to early stage oral carcinogenesis. The targeting of downstream factors by miR-31 may further advance the neoplastic progression of immortalized NOKs, allowing them to become malignant.",Carcinogenesis
4,BAP1 suppresses lung cancer progression and is inhibited by miR-31.,"BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1) is an important nuclear-localized deubiquitinating enzyme that serves as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer; however, its function and its regulation are largely unknown. In this study, we found that BAP1 protein levels were dramatically diminished in lung cancer tissues while its mRNA levels did not differ significantly, suggesting that a post-transcriptional mechanism was involved in BAP1 regulation. Because microRNAs (miRNAs) are powerful post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, we used bioinformatic analyses to search for miRNAs that could potentially bind BAP1. We predicted and experimentally validated miR-31 as a direct regulator of BAP1. Moreover, we showed that miR-31 promoted proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in lung cancer cells and accelerated the development of tumor growth in xenograft mice by inhibiting BAP1. Taken together, this study highlights an important role for miR-31 in the suppression of BAP1 in lung cancer cells and may provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of lung carcinogenesis.",Oncotarget
5,MiR-142-3p as a potential prognostic biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background and objectives: microRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, are always aberrantly expressed in many diseases including human cancers. The aim of this study was to examine and determine the clinical significance of hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR-142-3p, hsa-miR-338-3p, and hsa-miR-1261 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Methods: Expression levels of four selected miRNAs, initially evaluated by microarray, were validated by qRT-PCR. Various statistical methods were used to analyze the relationship between miRNA expression and clinicopathologic features and prognosis in 91 patients with ESCC. Results: MiR-31 and miR-142-3p expression were correlated to histological differentiation in ESCC (P < 0.05, Student's t-test); high miR-142-3p expression was associated with a poor prognosis in all 91 ESCC patients (P = 0.014, log-rank) and identified as an independent prognostic factor in ESCC (P = 0.017, univariate Cox; P = 0.022, multivariate Cox). More importantly, stratified analysis indicated that high miR-142-3p expression was correlated to a poor prognosis within good-prognosis groups comprised of ESCC patients with small tumor size, negative lymph node metastasis, or early stage (all P < 0.05). Conclusion: The main findings suggest that miR-142-3p is involved in the progression of ESCC and is a potential prognostic biomarker for ESCC.",Journal of surgical oncology
6,The oncogenetic role of microRNA-31 as a potential biomarker in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 (microRNA-31) is frequently altered in numerous cancers. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR-31 in ESCC (oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma). We measured miR-31 in 45 paired ESCC tissues and 523 serum samples using real-time RT (reverse transcription)-PCR. The serum samples were divided into a discovery group (120 ESCCs and 121 normal controls), a validation group (81 ESCCs and 81 controls), and a final group comprising six other common tumours (colorectal, liver, cervical, breast, gastric and lung cancers; total n=120). A Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon matched-pairs test were used for the statistics. miR-31 was up-regulated in 77.8% of the ESCC tissues. Serum miR-31 levels in ESCC patients were significantly higher than in normal controls (P<0.001). It yielded an ROC (receiver operating characteristic) AUC (area under the curve) of 0.902 [95% CI (confidence interval), 0.857-0.936] in the discovery group and a similar result in the validation group [ROC AUC, 0.888 (95% CI, 0.819-0.939)]. Patients with high-levels of serum miR-31 also had a poorer prognosis in relapse-free survival (P=0.001) and tumour-specific survival (P=0.005). In vitro studies showed that miR-31 promoted ESCC colony formation, migration and invasion. Luciferase reporter and Western blot assays confirmed that three tumour suppressor genes, namely EMP1 (epithelial membrane protein 1), KSR2 (kinase suppressor of ras 2) and RGS4 (regulator of G-protein signalling 4), were targeted by miR-31. We conclude that miR-31 plays oncogenetic functions and can serve as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for ESCC.","Clinical science (London, England : 1979)"
7,Down-regulation of the microRNA-99 family members in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Objectives: MicroRNA deregulation is a critical event in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Several microRNA profiling studies aimed at deciphering the microRNA signatures of HNSCC have been reported, but there tends to be poor agreement among studies. The objective of this study was to survey the published microRNA profiling studies on HNSCC, and to assess the commonly deregulated microRNAs in an independent sample set. Materials and methods: Meta-analysis of 13 published microRNA profiling studies was performed to define microRNA signatures in HNSCC. Selected microRNAs (including members of miR-99 family) were evaluated in an independent set of HNSCC cases. The potential contributions of miR-99 family to the tumorigenesis of HNSCC were assessed by in vitro assays. Results: We identified 67 commonly deregulated microRNAs. The up-regulation of miR-21, miR-155, miR-130b, miR-223 and miR-31, and the down-regulation of miR-100, miR-99a and miR-375 were further validated in an independent set of HNSCC cases with quantitative RT-PCR. Among these validated microRNAs, miR-100 and miR-99a belong to the miR-99 family. Our in vitro study demonstrated that restoration of miR-100 to the HNSCC cell lines suppressed cell proliferation and migration, and enhanced apoptosis. Furthermore, ectopic transfection of miR-99 family members down-regulated the expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) genes. Conclusion: In summary, we described a panel of frequently deregulated microRNAs in HNSCC, including members of miR-99 family. The deregulation of miR-99 family contributes to the tumorigenesis of HNSCC, in part by targeting IGF1R and mTOR signaling pathways.",Oral oncology
8,EGF up-regulates miR-31 through the C/EBPbeta signal cascade in oral carcinoma.,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is one of the most prevalent carcinomas worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and modulate physiological or pathological processes including OSCC carcinogenesis. miR-31 has been found to be up-regulated in OSCC and to act as an oncogenic miRNA. However, the molecular mechanism underlying miR-31 up-regulation in OSCC is still obscure. The activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling axis plays key roles in driving oral carcinogenesis. Our screening identified that there is up-regulation of miR-31, miR-181b and miR-222 in OSCC cells following EGF treatment. Subsequent analysis showed that EGF treatment led to AKT activation, which then resulted in miR-31 up-regulation. Moreover, EGF treatment and the AKT activation induced by exogenous expression up-regulated C/EBPÎ² expression. The miR-31 up-regulation induced by EGF was abrogated by AKT inhibition or by the knockdown of C/EBPÎ² expression. In OSCC cell subclones stably overexpressing the functional isoform of C/EBPÎ², miR-31 expression was up-regulated. Curcumin is a natural ingredient exhibiting anti-cancer potential. It was found that curcumin attenuated AKT activation and the up-regulation of C/EBPÎ² and miR-31 caused by EGF stimulation in OSCC cells. Lastly, concordance across the expression of EGFR, the expression of C/EBPÎ² and the expression of miR-31 in OSCC tissues was found. This study describes a novel scenario where the up-regulation of miR-31 expression in OSCC is, at least in part, a consequence of EGFR oncogenic activation. Although the AKT activation and C/EBPÎ² expression after EGF treatment might not be directly linked, both events are the crucial mediators underlying miR-31 up-regulation in the EGFR signaling axis.",PloS one
9,"Differential expression of microRNAs miR-21, miR-31, miR-203, miR-125a-5p and miR-125b and proteins PTEN and p63 in verrucous carcinoma of the head and neck.","Aims: To investigate the expression of microRNAs miR-21, miR-31, miR-203, miR-125a-5p and miR-125b and proteins phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) and p63 in verrucous carcinoma (VC) of the head and neck. Methods and results: Thirty cases of VC, 50 cases of conventional squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 30 samples of normal epithelium of the head and neck were included. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were used to analyse the expression of microRNAs and proteins, respectively. In comparison to normal epithelium, miR-21 was overexpressed in both VC and SCC and miR-31 was overexpressed in VC and in well- and moderately differentiated SCC. Levels of miR-203 were elevated in VC but unaltered or reduced in SCC, and levels of miR-125a-5p and miR-125b were reduced in VC but unaltered in SCC. PTEN was down-regulated in both VC and SCC, whereas p63 was down-regulated in VC but up-regulated in SCC. Differential expression of p63 in VC correlated inversely with the expression of miR-21 and miR-203. Conclusions: Differences between VC, SCC and normal epithelium in expression profiles of investigated molecules indicate their association with the pathogenesis and clinicopathological characteristics of VC. Our results suggest that some microRNAs and proteins, particularly miR-125b, miR-203 and p63, might be useful in the diagnosis of VC.",Histopathology
10,Mature miR-184 as Potential Oncogenic microRNA of Squamous Cell Carcinoma of Tongue.,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the microRNA expression patterns in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the tongue. Experimental design: Expression levels of 156 human mature microRNAs were examined using real-time quantitative PCR (Taq Man MicroRNA Assays; Human Panel) on laser microdissected cells of 4 tongue carcinomas and paired normal tissues. Expression of mature miR-184 was further validated in 20 paired tongue SCC and the normal tissues. Potential oncogenic functions of miR-184 were evaluated in tongue SCC cell lines (Cal27, HN21B, and HN96) with miR-184 inhibitor. Plasma miR-184 levels were evaluated using real-time quantitative PCR. Results: Using 3-fold expression difference as a cutoff level, we identified 24 up-regulated mature miRNAs including miR-184, miR-34c, miR-137, miR-372, miR-124a, miR-21, miR-124b, miR-31, miR-128a, miR-34b, miR-154, miR-197, miR-132, miR-147, miR-325, miR-181c, miR-198, miR-155, miR-30a-3p, miR-338, miR-17-5p, miR-104, miR-134, and miR-213; and 13 down-regulated mature miRNAs including miR-133a, miR-99a, miR-194, miR-133b, miR-219, miR-100, miR-125b, miR-26b, miR-138, miR-149, miR-195, miR-107, and miR-139. Overexpression of miR-184 was further validated in 20 paired tongue SCC and normal tissues (P = 0.002). Inhibition of miR-184 in tongue SCC cell lines could reduce cell proliferation rate. Down-regulation of c-Myc was observed in two cell lines in response to miR-184 inhibitor. Suppressing miR-184 could induce apoptosis in all three cell lines. Plasma miR-184 levels were significantly higher in tongue SCC patients in comparison with normal individuals, and the levels were significantly reduced after surgical removal of the primary tumors. Conclusions: Overexpression of miR-184 might play an oncogenic role in the antiapoptotic and proliferative processes of tongue SCC. In addition, plasma miR-184 levels were associated with the presence of primary tumor. Further studies on the aberrantly expressed miRNAs in tongue SCC as well as using plasma miRNAs as novel tumor markers are warranted.",Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research
11,Tumor suppression by miR-31 in esophageal carcinoma is p21-dependent.,"microRNA regulation network is important for the cancer genetic heterogeneity. Relative to the increasing numbers of microRNA's targets identified, upstream regulatory mechanisms that control functional microRNAs are less well-documented. Here, we investigated the function of miR-31, a pleiotropically-acting microRNA, in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC). We demonstrated that miR-31 only exerted tumor-suppressive effects in TE-7 ESCC cells, but not in TE-1 ESCC cells, although both of these cell lines harbor inactive p53. Interestingly, TE-1 cells highly expressed p21, while p21 levels were virtually undetectable in TE-7 cells, suggesting a p21-dependent mechanism of miR-31-mediated tumor suppression. Accordingly, knockdown of p21 in TE-1 cells reversed the tumor suppressive actions of miR-31. In patient ESCC specimens, real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that expression of E2F2 and STK40, two known miR-31 target oncogenes, was negatively correlated with the expression of miR-31 in a p21-dependent manner, supporting the conclusion that miR-31 only downregulates its target oncogenes when p21 levels are low. Collectively, these data suggest a novel mechanism through which the tumor-suppressive effect of miR-31 is p21-dependent. In addition, we speculate that delivery of miR-31 could provide therapeutic benefit in the personalized management of a subgroup of ESCC patients with p21-deficient tumors.",Genes & cancer
12,"MicroRNA-125b down-regulates matrix metallopeptidase 13 and inhibits cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.","Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common human cancer. Although dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is known to be involved in a variety of cancers, the role of miRNAs in cSCC is unclear. In this study, we aimed to identify tumor suppressive and oncogenic miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of cSCC. MiRNA expression profiles in healthy skins (n = 4) and cSCCs (n = 4) were analyzed using MicroRNA Low Density Array. MiR-125b expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and in situ hybridization in skin biopsies from 40 healthy donors, 13 actinic keratosis, and 74 cSCC patients. The effect of miR-125b was analyzed in wound closure, colony formation, migration, and invasion assays in two cSCC cell lines, UT-SCC-7 and A431. The genes regulated by miR-125b in cSCC were identified by microarray analysis and its direct target was validated by luciferase reporter assay. Comparing cSCC with healthy skin, we identified four up-regulated miRNAs (miR-31, miR-135b, miR-21, and miR-223) and 54 down-regulated miRNAs, including miR-125b, whose function was further examined. We found that miR-125b suppressed proliferation, colony formation, migratory, and invasive capacity of cSCC cells. Matrix metallopeptidase 13 (MMP13) was identified as a direct target suppressed by miR-125b, and there was an inverse relationship between the expression of miR-125b and MMP13 in cSCC. Knockdown of MMP13 expression phenocopied the effects of miR-125b overexpression. These findings provide a novel molecular mechanism by which MMP13 is up-regulated in cSCCs and indicate that miR-125b plays a tumor suppressive role in cSCC.",The Journal of biological chemistry

0,Exploiting salivary miR-31 as a clinical biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Oral carcinoma is an important malignancy throughout the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional levels of targeted mRNAs. MiRNA-31(miR-31) is significantly upregulated in oral carcinoma tissues and plays oncogenic roles in oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the levels of miR-31 in saliva of patients with oral carcinoma (n = 45), oral verrucous leukoplakia (n = 10), and control healthy individuals (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Salivary miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors. However, our preliminary analysis showed no increase of salivary miR-31 in patients with oral verrucous leukoplakia relative to controls. The miR-31 was more abundant in saliva than in plasma, suggesting salivary miR-31 was a more sensitive marker for oral malignancy. After excision of oral carcinoma, salivary miR-31 was remarkably reduced, indicating that most of the upregulated salivary miR-31 came from tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results point to a potential application of salivary miR-31 as a biomarker for early detection and postoperative follow-up of oral carcinoma.",Head & neck
1,miR-31 targets ARID1A and enhances the oncogenicity and stemness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 is oncogenic for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Proteins containing the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID) modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcription machinery needed for gene expression. In this study, we showed that miR-31 was able to target ARID1A in HNSCC. HNSCC tumors had an inverse miR-31 and ARID1A expression. miR-31 associated oncogenicities were rescued by ARID1A expression in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ARID1A repressed the stemness properties and transcriptional activity of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM via the protein's affinity for AT-rich sites within promoters. HNSCC patients with tumors having high level of miR-31 expression and high levels of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM expression, together with low level of ARID1A expression, were found to have the worst survival. This study provides novel mechanistic clues demonstrating that miR-31 inhibits ARID1A and that this enriches the oncogenicity and stemness of HNSCC.",Oncotarget
2,MiR-31-5p-ACOX1 Axis Enhances Tumorigenic Fitness in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Via the Promigratory Prostaglandin E2.,"During neoplastic development, a multitude of changes in genome-encoded information are progressively selected to confer growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. microRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks, given their role as a critical layer of robust gene expression control, are frequently altered in neoplasm. However, whether and how these gene perturbations impact metabolic homeostasis remains largely unresolved. Methods: Through targeted miRNA expression screening, we uncovered an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-associated miRNAome, among which miR-31-5p was identified based on extent of up-regulation, functional impact on OSCC cell migration and invasion, and direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal β-oxidation, ACOX1. Results: We further found that both miR-31-5p and ACOX1 underpin, in an antagonistic manner, the overall cellular lipidome profiles as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC cells. Interestingly, the extracellular levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate of ACOX1, were controlled by the miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis, and were shown to positively influence the extent of cell motility in correlation with metastatic status. The promigratory effect of this metabolite was mediated by an elevation in EP1-ERK-MMP9 signaling. Of note, functional significance of this regulatory pathway was further corroborated by its clinicopathologically-correlated expression in OSCC patient specimens. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings outlined a model whereby misregulated miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis in tumor alters lipid metabolomes, consequently eliciting an intracellular signaling change to enhance cell motility. Our clinical analysis also unveiled PGE2 as a viable salivary biomarker for prognosticating oral cancer progression, further underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis.",Theranostics
3,miR-31 ablates expression of the HIF regulatory factor FIH to activate the HIF pathway in head and neck carcinoma.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenously expressed noncoding RNAs with important biological and pathological functions that are yet to be fully defined. This study investigated alterations in miRNA expression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), the incidence of which is rising throughout the world. Initial screening and subsequent analysis identified a panel of aberrantly expressed miRNAs in HNSCC tissues, with miR-31 among the most markedly upregulated. Ectopic expression of miR-31 increased the oncogenic potential of HNSCC cells under normoxic conditions in cell culture or tumor xenografts. Conversely, blocking miR-31 expression reduced the growth of tumor xenografts. The in silico analysis suggested that miR-31 may target the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of factor-inhibiting hypoxia-inducible factor (FIH), a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) regulatory factor that inhibits the ability of HIF to act as a transcriptional regulator under normoxic conditions. In support of this likelihood, miR-31 expression repressed FIH expression and mutations within the predictive miR-31 target site in the FIH 3' UTR abrogated FIH repression. Furthermore, miR-31 expression increased HIF transactivation activity. We found that FIH suppressed oncogenic phenotypes under normoxic conditions and that this activity was abrogated by functional mutations. Lastly, increased miR-31 expression was correlated with decreased levels of FIH in tumor tissues. Our findings suggest that miR-31 contributes to the development of HNSCC by impeding FIH to activate HIF under normoxic conditions.",Cancer research
4,Integrated genomic analyses of lung squamous cell carcinoma for identification of a possible competitive endogenous RNA network by means of TCGA datasets.,"The etiology of cancer includes aberrant cellular homeostasis where a compromised RNA regulatory network is a prominent contributing factor. In particular, noncoding RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) were recently shown to play important roles in the initiation, progression, and metastasis of human cancers. Nonetheless, a mechanistic understanding of noncoding RNA functions in lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) is lacking. To fill this critical gap in knowledge, we obtained mRNA, miRNA, and lncRNA expression data on patients with LUSC from the updated Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (2016). We successfully identified 3,366 mRNAs, 79 miRNAs, and 151 lncRNAs as key contributing factors of a high risk of LUSC. Furthermore, we hypothesized that the lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory axis positively correlates with LUSC and constructed a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network of LUSC by targeting interrelations with significantly aberrant expression data between miRNA and mRNA or lncRNA. Six ceRNAs (PLAU, miR-31-5p, miR-455-3p, FAM83A-AS1, MIR31HG, and MIR99AHG) significantly correlated with survival (P < 0.05). Finally, real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that PLAU is significantly upregulated in SK-MES-1 cells compared with 16-BBE-T cells. Taken together, our findings represent new knowledge for a better understanding the ceRNA network in LUSC biology and pave the way to improved diagnosis and prognosis of LUSC.",PeerJ
5,"The microRNAs, MiR-31 and MiR-375, as candidate markers in Barrett's esophageal carcinogenesis.","There is a critical need to identify molecular markers that can reliably aid in stratifying esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) risk in patients with Barrett's esophagus. MicroRNAs (miRNA/miR) are one such class of biomolecules. In the present cross-sectional study, we characterized miRNA alterations in progressive stages of neoplastic development, i.e., metaplasia-dysplasia-adenocarcinoma, with an aim to identify candidate miRNAs potentially associated with progression. Using next generation sequencing (NGS) as an agnostic discovery platform, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) validation in a total of 20 EACs, we identified 26 miRNAs that are highly and frequently deregulated in EACs (≥ 4-fold in >50% of cases) when compared to paired normal esophageal squamous (nSQ) tissue. We then assessed the 26 EAC-derived miRNAs in laser microdissected biopsy pairs of Barrett's metaplasia (BM)/nSQ (n = 15), and high-grade dysplasia (HGD)/nSQ (n = 14) by qPCR, to map the timing of deregulation during progression from BM to HGD and to EAC. We found that 23 of the 26 candidate miRNAs were deregulated at the earliest step, BM, and therefore noninformative as molecular markers of progression. Two miRNAs, miR-31 and -31*, however, showed frequent downregulation only in HGD and EAC cases suggesting association with transition from BM to HGD. A third miRNA, miR-375, showed marked downregulation exclusively in EACs and in none of the BM or HGD lesions, suggesting its association with progression to invasive carcinoma. Taken together, we propose miR-31 and -375 as novel candidate microRNAs specifically associated with early- and late-stage malignant progression, respectively, in Barrett's esophagus.","Genes, chromosomes & cancer"
6,"Novel candidate key drivers in the integrative network of genes, microRNAs, methylations, and copy number variations in squamous cell lung carcinoma.","The mechanisms of lung cancer are highly complex. Not only mRNA gene expression but also microRNAs, DNA methylation, and copy number variation (CNV) play roles in tumorigenesis. It is difficult to incorporate so much information into a single model that can comprehensively reflect all these lung cancer mechanisms. In this study, we analyzed the 129 TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) squamous cell lung carcinoma samples with gene expression, microRNA expression, DNA methylation, and CNV data. First, we used variance inflation factor (VIF) regression to build the whole genome integrative network. Then, we isolated the lung cancer subnetwork by identifying the known lung cancer genes and their direct regulators. This subnetwork was refined by the Bayesian method, and the directed regulations among mRNA genes, microRNAs, methylations, and CNVs were obtained. The novel candidate key drivers in this refined subnetwork, such as the methylation of ARHGDIB and HOXD3, microRNA let-7a and miR-31, and the CNV of AGAP2, were identified and analyzed. On three large public available lung cancer datasets, the key drivers ARHGDIB and HOXD3 demonstrated significant associations with the overall survival of lung cancer patients. Our results provide new insights into lung cancer mechanisms.",BioMed research international
7,Different miRNA signatures of oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas: a prospective translational study.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs, which regulate mRNA translation/decay, and may serve as biomarkers. We characterised the expression of miRNAs in clinically sampled oral and pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC and PSCC) and described the influence of human papilloma virus (HPV). Methods: Biopsies obtained from 51 patients with OSCC/PSCC and 40 control patients were used for microarray analysis. The results were correlated to clinical data and HPV status. Supervised learning by support vector machines was employed to generate a diagnostic miRNA signature. Results: One hundred and fourteen miRNAs were differentially expressed between OSCC and normal oral epithelium, with the downregulation of miR-375 and upregulation of miR-31 as the most significant aberrations. Pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma exhibited 38 differentially expressed miRNAs compared with normal pharyngeal epithelium. Differences in the miRNA expression pattern of both normal epithelium and SCC were observed between the oral cavity compared with the pharynx. Human papilloma virus infection revealed perturbations of 21 miRNAs, most significantly in miR-127-3p and miR363. A molecular classifier including 61 miRNAs was generated for OSCC with an accuracy of 93%. Conclusion: MicroRNAs may serve as useful biomarkers in OSCC and PSCC. The influence of HPV on miRNA may provide a mechanism for the distinct clinical behaviour of HPV-infected tumours.",British journal of cancer
8,miR-31 functions as an oncogene in cervical cancer.,"Background: MicroRNAs are frequently altered in numerous cancers and are critical regulators of various diseases. miR-31 has been shown to be significantly altered in a variety of cancers. Methods: In the present study, we measured the expression level of miR-31 in cervical cancer, CIN and normal cervical tissues by real-time RT (reverse transcription)-PCR. We also analyzed the correlations between the expression level of miR-31 and the clinical characteristics in cases of cervical squamous cell carcinoma. In addition, we measured the expression of miR-31 in cervical cancer cell lines, and transfected HPV16 E6 siRNA and HPV16 E7 siRNA into SiHa cells to investigate the effects on miR-31. Finally, the effects of miR-31 on cell proliferation, migration and invasion were measured in HeLa and SiHa cells that were transfected with a miR-31 mimic or a negative control. Result: We found that the expression level of miR-31 was significantly higher in cervical cancer patients than in normal individuals (P < 0.05). Aberrant expression of miR-31 was positively correlated with the lymph node metastasis (LNM), vessel invasion and HPV status (P < 0.05). Additionally, miR-31 was also overexpressed in the cervical cancer-derived HeLa and SiHa cells compared with C33A cells (P < 0.05). Moreover, a relationship was found between miR-31 expression and the HPV16 oncoproteins E6/E7. Furthermore, we found that the overexpression of miR-31 can promote cell proliferation and enhance the migration and invasion abilities of cancer cells. Conclusions: Our results suggested that miR-31 plays an oncogenetic role in the development and progression of cervical cancer.",Archives of gynecology and obstetrics
9,"Diagnostic and prognostic relevance of salivary microRNA-21, -125a, -31 and -200a levels in patients with oral lichen planus - a short report.","Background: Oral lichen planus (OLP), a relatively common chronic inflammatory disease of the oral mucosa, is considered to be a premalignant disorder of the oral cavity. Previously, several biomarkers have been tested for their diagnostic potential. Here, we aimed to investigate the diagnostic potential of four miRNAs, miR-21, -125a, -31 and -200a, known to be involved in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) development, in the saliva of OLP patients as also their putative relation to OSCC development in these patients. Materials and methods: Saliva samples from 30 patients with OLP were collected, 15 of whom were diagnosed with dysplasia upon histopathologic examination. In addition, 15 saliva samples from patients with OSCC and 15 saliva samples from healthy donors were collected. After RNA extraction, the respective miRNA levels were assessed by quantitative RT-PCR. Results: We found that the miR-21 levels were significantly increased in saliva samples derived from patients with OLP, dysplastic OLP and OSCC, compared to those from healthy controls (p = 0.012, p = 0.0017 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Conversely, significant decreases in miR-125a levels were found in the OLP, dysplastic OLP and OSCC samples, compared to those from healthy controls (p < 0.0014, p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001, respectively). In addition, significant increases in miR-31 levels were found in samples derived from dysplastic OLP and OSCC patients, but not in those from nondysplastic OLP patients, compared to those in healthy controls (p = 0.01 and p = 0.004, respectively). Finally, we found that the miR-200a levels were significantly decreased only in samples derived from OSCC patients (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: From our data we conclude that increased miR-21 levels in conjunction with decreased miR-125a levels in saliva of OLP patients may be indicative for a poor prognosis. Conversely, we conclude that lack of significant alterations in miR-31 and miR-200a levels in saliva of OLP patients may be indicative for absence of malignant transformation.",Cellular oncology (Dordrecht)
10,MicroRNA Expression Profiling of Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinomas Arising in Different Sites.,"Objective: To examine the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) tumors from aggressive head and neck locations compared with nonaggressive anatomic sites and normal controls. Study design: Retrospective analysis of miRNA expression. Setting: Tertiary care center. Subjects and methods: Tissue samples were collected from 3 anatomic regions: aggressive head and neck sites (ie, ears/lip), nonaggressive locations (ie, extremities/trunk), and adjacent normal skin. RNA was isolated from tissue cores of 45 samples (18 aggressive sites, 15 nonaggressive sites, and 12 normal-adjacent skin). miRNA expression analysis was completed for approximately 800 miRNAs using the NanoString nCounter panel. Five candidate miRNAs were selected for validation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed on the original samples plus 30 additional tissue samples (7 aggressive sites, 14 nonaggressive sites, and 9 normal-adjacent skin). Results: Five candidate miRNAs with significant differences in miRNA expression (P < 0 ≤ .001) from discovery samples were selected: miR-21, miR-31, let-7g, miR-93, and miR-22. Relative expression for these miRNAs using qRT-PCR in the new sample set did not reveal any significant differences using 1-way analysis of variance. When sets were combined, miR-21 showed increased expression in aggressive tumors relative to nonaggressive tumors (P = .009), but no others reached statistical significance. Conclusion: cSCC behaves more aggressively when originating from specific anatomical subsites of the head and neck. Of 5 miRNAs evaluated, only miR-21 showed significantly higher expression in tumors from aggressive sites relative to nonaggressive sites. Larger sample sizes are needed to evaluate other miRNAs.",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery
11,MicroRNA expression differs in cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas and healthy skin of immunocompetent individuals.,"Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is one of the most common skin cancers, but the influence of microRNA (miRNA) expression has only been sporadically analysed. We hypothesized that miRNAs are differentially expressed in cSCC and hence influence its development. We therefore isolated total miRNA from well-differentiated cSCCs and from controls without SCC. Expression analyses of 12 miRNAs showed three significantly differentially expressed miRNAs. We identified a significant upregulation of the miR-21 and the miR-31, a proto-oncogene like miR-21. While the upregulated expression of miR-21 has been known for some time, the increased expression of miR-31 was never shown so clearly. Furthermore, we showed the upregulation of miRNA-205, which has never been described before. The miR-205 induces specific keratinocyte migration and could be a characteristic marker for cSCC. It has to be determined in following studies whether these upregulated expressions are specific for cSCC and if so, for which cSCC stages.",Experimental dermatology
12,MicroRNA-31 Regulates Expression of Wntless in Both Drosophila melanogaster and Human Oral Cancer Cells.,"Recent comparative studies have indicated distinct expression profiles of short, non-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) in various types of cancer, including oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). In this study, we employed a hybrid approach using Drosophila melanogaster as well as OSCC cell lines to validate putative targets of oral cancer-related miRNAs both in vivo and in vitro. Following overexpression of Drosophila miR-31, we found a significant decrease in the size of the imaginal wing discs and downregulation of a subset of putative targets, including wntless (wls), an important regulator of the Wnt signaling pathway. Parallel experiments performed in OSCC cells have also confirmed a similar miR-31-dependent regulation of human WLS that was not initially predicted as targets of human miR-31. Furthermore, we found subsequent downregulation of cyclin D1 and c-MYC, two of the main transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling, suggesting a potential role of miR-31 in regulating the cell cycle and proliferation of OSCC cells. Taken together, our Drosophila-based in vivo system in conjunction with the human in vitro platform will thus provide a novel insight into a mammal-to-Drosophila-to-mammal approach to validate putative targets of human miRNA and to better understand the miRNA-target relationships that play an important role in the pathophysiology of oral cancer.",International journal of molecular sciences

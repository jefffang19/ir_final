0,Exploiting salivary miR-31 as a clinical biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Oral carcinoma is an important malignancy throughout the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional levels of targeted mRNAs. MiRNA-31(miR-31) is significantly upregulated in oral carcinoma tissues and plays oncogenic roles in oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the levels of miR-31 in saliva of patients with oral carcinoma (n = 45), oral verrucous leukoplakia (n = 10), and control healthy individuals (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Salivary miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors. However, our preliminary analysis showed no increase of salivary miR-31 in patients with oral verrucous leukoplakia relative to controls. The miR-31 was more abundant in saliva than in plasma, suggesting salivary miR-31 was a more sensitive marker for oral malignancy. After excision of oral carcinoma, salivary miR-31 was remarkably reduced, indicating that most of the upregulated salivary miR-31 came from tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results point to a potential application of salivary miR-31 as a biomarker for early detection and postoperative follow-up of oral carcinoma.",Head & neck
1,miR-31 targets ARID1A and enhances the oncogenicity and stemness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 is oncogenic for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Proteins containing the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID) modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcription machinery needed for gene expression. In this study, we showed that miR-31 was able to target ARID1A in HNSCC. HNSCC tumors had an inverse miR-31 and ARID1A expression. miR-31 associated oncogenicities were rescued by ARID1A expression in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ARID1A repressed the stemness properties and transcriptional activity of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM via the protein's affinity for AT-rich sites within promoters. HNSCC patients with tumors having high level of miR-31 expression and high levels of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM expression, together with low level of ARID1A expression, were found to have the worst survival. This study provides novel mechanistic clues demonstrating that miR-31 inhibits ARID1A and that this enriches the oncogenicity and stemness of HNSCC.",Oncotarget
2,MiR-31-5p-ACOX1 Axis Enhances Tumorigenic Fitness in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Via the Promigratory Prostaglandin E2.,"During neoplastic development, a multitude of changes in genome-encoded information are progressively selected to confer growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. microRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks, given their role as a critical layer of robust gene expression control, are frequently altered in neoplasm. However, whether and how these gene perturbations impact metabolic homeostasis remains largely unresolved. Methods: Through targeted miRNA expression screening, we uncovered an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-associated miRNAome, among which miR-31-5p was identified based on extent of up-regulation, functional impact on OSCC cell migration and invasion, and direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal β-oxidation, ACOX1. Results: We further found that both miR-31-5p and ACOX1 underpin, in an antagonistic manner, the overall cellular lipidome profiles as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC cells. Interestingly, the extracellular levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate of ACOX1, were controlled by the miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis, and were shown to positively influence the extent of cell motility in correlation with metastatic status. The promigratory effect of this metabolite was mediated by an elevation in EP1-ERK-MMP9 signaling. Of note, functional significance of this regulatory pathway was further corroborated by its clinicopathologically-correlated expression in OSCC patient specimens. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings outlined a model whereby misregulated miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis in tumor alters lipid metabolomes, consequently eliciting an intracellular signaling change to enhance cell motility. Our clinical analysis also unveiled PGE2 as a viable salivary biomarker for prognosticating oral cancer progression, further underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis.",Theranostics
3,Dissection of miRNA-miRNA interaction in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"The relationships between miRNAs and their regulatory influences in esophageal carcinoma remain largely unknown. Accumulated evidence suggests that delineation of subpathways within an entire pathway can underlie complex diseases. To analyze the regulation of differentially expressed miRNAs in subpathways of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), we constructed bipartite miRNA and subpathway networks to determine miRNA regulatory influences on subpathways. The miRNA-subpathway network indicated that miRNAs regulate numerous subpathways. Two principal biological networks were derived from the miRNA-subpathway network by the hypergeometric test. This miRNA-miRNA network revealed the co-regulation of subpathways between the upregulated and downregulated miRNAs. Subpathway-subpathway networks characterized scale free, small world, and modular architecture. K-clique analysis revealed co-regulation of subpathways between certain downregulated and upregulated miRNAs. When ESCC patients were grouped according to their expression levels of paired upregulation of miR-31 and downregulation of miR-338-3p, survival time analysis revealed a significant difference based on miR-31-miR-338-3p interaction. These findings can facilitate the understanding of the biological meaning of miRNA-miRNA interactions with either the same or opposite expression trend.",PloS one
4,MicroRNA dysregulation and esophageal cancer development depend on the extent of zinc dietary deficiency.,"Zinc deficiency (ZD) increases the risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), and marginal ZD is prevalent in humans. In rats, marked-ZD (3 mg Zn/kg diet) induces a proliferative esophagus with a 5-microRNA signature (miR-31, -223, -21, -146b, -146a) and promotes ESCC. Here we report that moderate and mild-ZD (6 and 12 mg Zn/kg diet) also induced esophageal hyperplasia, albeit less pronounced than induced by marked-ZD, with a 2-microRNA signature (miR-31, -146a). On exposure to an environmental carcinogen, ~16% of moderate/mild-ZD rats developed ESCC, a cancer incidence significantly greater than for Zn-sufficient rats (0%) (P ≤ 0.05), but lower than marked-ZD rats (68%) (P < 0.001). Importantly, the high ESCC, marked-ZD esophagus had a 15-microRNA signature, resembling the human ESCC miRNAome, with miR-223, miR-21, and miR-31 as the top-up-regulated species. This signature discriminated it from the low ESCC, moderate/mild-ZD esophagus, with a 2-microRNA signature (miR-31, miR-223). Additionally, Fbxw7, Pdcd4, and Stk40 (tumor-suppressor targets of miR-223, -21, and -31) were downregulated in marked-ZD cohort. Bioinformatics analysis predicted functional relationships of the 3 tumor-suppressors with other cancer-related genes. Thus, microRNA dysregulation and ESCC progression depend on the extent of dietary Zn deficiency. Our findings suggest that even moderate ZD may promote esophageal cancer and dietary Zn has preventive properties against ESCC. Additionally, the deficiency-associated miR-223, miR-21, and miR-31 may be useful therapeutic targets in ESCC.",Oncotarget
5,Correlation of miRNAs With Prognosis in Composite Tissue Allotransplantation.,"Objectives: The number of composite tissue allotransplant procedures is increasing and has gained popularity. As with other transplant procedures, early detection of possible pathologies is as important as clinical follow-up. The present study investigated the correlation between microRNA expression levels and clinical follow-up of individuals undergoing composite tissue transplant. Materials and methods: Whole microRNA expression levels were analyzed from peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from preoperative and postoperative blood of patients who underwent facial transplant. Analyses were performed using microRNA levels from patients' preoperative blood samples. Results: The clinical findings of patients with facial transplant were correlated with individual miRNA expression level changes. The expression of miR-31, the high expression of which has been linked to rejection, was significantly low in our patients. No expression changes were observed in other rejection-related microRNAs. Grade 1 rejection was generally seen in our patients, and these findings are consistent with the degree and frequency of rejection episodes in our cases. In addition, immunosuppression-associated diseases such as squamous cell carcinoma, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders, and aspergillosis, which are encountered clinically, were found to correlate with expression changes in microRNAs such as miR-150-5p, miR-21-5p, miR-17-5p, miR-20a-5p, and miR-3607-5p. Conclusions: Defining the clinical findings and immunosuppression-associated pathologies encountered in composite tissue transplant using biomarkers such as microRNA can play an important role in the improvement of these transplant procedures and in predicting patient morbidity. Therefore, the use of microRNAs may be useful in the clinical follow-up of patients who have received composite tissue allotransplant.",Experimental and clinical transplantation : official journal of the Middle East Society for Organ Transplantation
6,Functional evidence that Drosha overexpression in cervical squamous cell carcinoma affects cell phenotype and microRNA profiles.,"Although gain of chromosome 5p is one of the most frequent DNA copy-number imbalances in cervical squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), the genes that drive its selection remain poorly understood. In a previous cross-sectional clinical study, we showed that the microRNA processor Drosha (located on chromosome 5p) demonstrates frequent copy-number gain and overexpression in cervical SCC, associated with altered microRNA profiles. Here, we have conducted gene depletion/overexpression experiments to demonstrate the functional significance of up-regulated Drosha in cervical SCC cells. Drosha depletion by RNA interference (RNAi) produced significant, specific reductions in cell motility/invasiveness in vitro, with a silent RNAi-resistant Drosha mutation providing phenotype rescue. Unsupervised hierarchical clustering following global profiling of 319 microRNAs in 18 cervical SCC cell line specimens generated two groups according to Drosha expression levels. Altering Drosha levels in individual SCC lines changed the group into which the cells clustered, with gene depletion effects being rescued by the RNAi-resistant mutation. Forty-five microRNAs showed significant differential expression between the groups, including four of 14 that were differentially expressed in association with Drosha levels in clinical samples. miR-31 up-regulation in Drosha-overexpressing samples/cell lines was the highest-ranked change (by adjusted p value) in both analyses, an observation validated by northern blotting. These functional data support the role of Drosha as an oncogene in cervical SCC, by affecting expression of cancer-associated microRNAs that have the potential to regulate numerous protein-coding genes.",The Journal of pathology
7,Serum microRNA Signature Is Capable of Early Diagnosis for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Despite decades of efforts, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains the leading cause of cancer mortality globally primarily due to the challenge in early detection of the cancer. Being an important player in cancer development, the dysregulated miRNAs have been shown promising values as non-invasive diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. The aim of our study is to access the efficacy and reliability of a potential circulating miRNA panel in early diagnosis of NSCLC. We first selected eight candidate miRNAs, miR-146b, miR-205, miR-29c, miR-31, miR-30b, miR-337, miR-411, and miR-708, which have been shown frequently aberrant in primary NSCLC patients based on our previous studies and other reports. The serum level of each of these miRNAs was evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in training and testing sets. We found that 5 out of 8 miRNAs (miR-146b, miR-205, miR-29c, miR-30b, and miR-337) were significantly up-regulated in NSCLCs patients compared to healthy or cancer-free controls in both training and testing sets. Based on the logistic regression model, a 4-miRNAs set (miR-146b, miR-205, miR-29c and miR-30b) was picked out of the 5 miRNAs owing to its excellent diagnostic power for NSCLC patients in the training set (AUC=0.99, accuracy=95.00%), the testing set (AUC=0.93, accuracy=89.69%), and the training-testing combined set ( AUC=0.96, accuracy=92.00%). When pathological subtypes of NSCLC are compared, this 4-miRNA panel carried a relatively higher prediction power and higher sensitivity for adenocarcinoma (AC) (AUC=0.98, sensitivity=99.10%) than for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (AUC=0.93, sensitivity=90.32%). Additionally, this panel demonstrated a comparable diagnostic capacity for stage I (AUC=0.96) and stage II-III (AUC=0.95) of NSCLC, suggesting its role in reflecting the tumor load. Importantly, the high levels of miR-146b and miR-29c in serum were significantly associated with poor 5-year overall survival (OS) (both p=0.04). Further survival analysis showed that high level of miR-146b in serum is specifically correlated with poor survival rate in SCC patients (p=0.0035) but not in AC patients (p=0.83), consistent with our previous finding that the high tissue expression of miR-146b in lung cancer specimen is indicative of a poor prognosis for SCC patients. Altogether, our study demonstrated that the 4-miRNA panel is a novel, sensitive and non-invasive serum marker for the early diagnosis of NSCLC.",International journal of biological sciences
8,MicroRNA aberrances in head and neck cancer: pathogenetic and clinical significance.,"Purpose of review: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play crucial roles in modulating the neoplastic process of cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). miRNAs modulate pathogenesis by inhibiting target genes. Understanding how aberrant miRNAs are involved in HNSCC pathogenesis should help to validate potential clinical applications that target these entities. Recent findings: miR-21, miR-31, miR-504 and miR-10b are important oncogenic miRNAs that are involved in HNSCC and target tumour suppressor genes. The tumour suppressor roles of the let-7 family, the miR-99 family, miR-107, miR-133a, miR-137, miR-138 and miR-375 with respect to their targeting of oncogenes are unequivocal and have been confirmed by many studies. In addition, miR-21, let-7, miR-107, miR-138 and miR-200c seem to play complicated roles in regulating stemness or the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of tumour cells. The clinical implications of these tumour-associated miRNAs are generally in agreement with their functional roles. Summary: A number of pathways that become disregulated by aberrant miRNAs have been identified specifically for HNSCC. Analysis of these networks and their therapeutic interception might facilitate the prediction of disease status and help with the design of therapeutic trials.",Current opinion in otolaryngology & head and neck surgery
9,Passenger strand miRNA miR-31* regulates the phenotypes of oral cancer cells by targeting RhoA.,"Objectives: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs that negatively regular target gene expression by RNA interference. The processing of the pre-miRNA hairpin generates a miRNA duplex, which consists of a miRNA (guide strand) and a miRNA(*) (passenger strand). miR-31 is an oncogenic miRNA and is up-regulated in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). miR-31(*) shows a high level of conservation across species and, based on this, this study hypothesized that miR-31(*) is a functional miRNA. Materials and methods: The expression of miR-31 and miR-31* in OSCC tissues and oral cells were analyzed. Functional studies were performed on OSCC cells. Results: miR-31(*) is up-regulated in OSCC tissues, but its expression is less abundant than miR-31. miR-31(*) decreases the proliferation and migration of both SAS and Fadu cells. Furthermore, miR-31(*) targets the 3'UTR of RhoA and is able to down-regulate RhoA expression. Knockdown of RhoA expression is known to decrease the proliferation and migration of OSCC cells. However, up-regulation of both miR-31 and miR-31(*) by delivery of pre-mir-31 does still enhance OSCC oncogenicity. Conclusion: miR-31(*) is a functional miRNA involving in regulating RhoA, and the activity of miR-31(*)'s activity seems to counteract the functions of miR-31 during OSCC tumorigenesis.",Oral oncology
10,The increase of oncogenic miRNA expression in tongue carcinogenesis of a mouse model.,"Objectives: This study investigated the oncogenic miRNA level in the tissue and biofluids in the Nitroquinoline 1-Oxide (4NQO)-induced mouse tongue carcinogenesis model for potential diagnostic or therapeutic application. Materials and methods: The histological examination, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, quantitative PCR analysis and bioinformatic algorithms were performed to unravel the signaling activation and miRNA expression in female murine samples. Results: The increase of miR-21 and miR-31 staining, and EGFR activation paralleled the severity of 4NQO-induced epithelial pathogenesis in tongue epithelium. A progressive increase of miR-21, miR-31 and miR-146a in both saliva and plasma samples was also noted. miR-31 was the earliest emerging miRNA in the saliva. The increase of plasma miR-146a, miR-184 and miR-372 was detectable early in the induction, and it was particularly eminent at the most advanced lesion state. The combined analysis of the multiple oncogenic miRNAs in the plasma signified a potent discriminative capacity between normal and pathological states. As the blockage of EGFR or AKT activation drastically reverted the miR-21, miR-31 and miR-146a expression induced by 4NQO in human oral carcinoma cell lines, the results implicated a mechanistic linkage of the oncogenic miRNAs' induction through EGFR/AKT activation. Conclusions: In this study, we show the dysregulation of oncogenic miRNAs in murine tongue tumorigenesis, which simulates human counterparts. Increased multiple miRNAs in the biofluids may be valuable non-invasive markers in detecting oral carcinogenesis at an early stage. This animal model may also be useful for developing liquid biopsies and prevention strategies against oral carcinoma by abrogating EGFR or oncogenic miRNAs.",Oral oncology
11,SOX4 interacts with EZH2 and HDAC3 to suppress microRNA-31 in invasive esophageal cancer cells.,"Background: Tumor metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer-related deaths. Recently, a strong link between microRNA dysregulation and human cancers has been established. However, the molecular mechanisms through which microRNAs regulate metastasis and cancer progression remain unclear. Methods: We analyzed the reciprocal expression regulation of miR-31 and SOX4 in esophageal squamous and adenocarcinoma cell lines by qRT-PCR and Western blotting using overexpression and shRNA knock-down approaches. Furthermore, methylation studies were used to assess epigenetic regulation of expression. Functionally, we determined the cellular consequences using migration and invasion assays, as well as proliferation assays. Immunoprecipitation and ChIP were used to identify complex formation of SOX4 and co-repressor components. Results: Here, we report that SOX4 promotes esophageal tumor cell proliferation and invasion by silencing miR-31 via activation and stabilization of a co-repressor complex with EZH2 and HDAC3. We demonstrate that miR-31 is significantly decreased in invasive esophageal cancer cells, while upregulation of miR-31 inhibits growth, migration and invasion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cell lines. miR-31, in turn, targets SOX4 for degradation by directly binding to its 3'-UTR. Additionally, miR-31 regulates EZH2 and HDAC3 indirectly. SOX4, EZH2 and HDAC3 levels inversely correlate with miR-31 expression in ESCC cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-31 in ESCC and EAC cell lines leads to down regulation of SOX4, EZH2 and HDAC3. Conversely, pharmacologic and genetic inhibition of SOX4 and EZH2 restore miR-31 expression. We show that SOX4, EZH2 and HDAC3 form a co-repressor complex that binds to the miR-31 promoter, repressing miR-31 through an epigenetic mark by H3K27me3 and by histone acetylation. Clinically, when compared to normal adjacent tissues, esophageal tumor samples show upregulation of SOX4, EZH2, and HDAC3, and EZH2 expression is significantly increased in metastatic ESCC tissues. Conclusions: Thus, we identified a novel molecular mechanism by which the SOX4, EZH2 and miR-31 circuit promotes tumor progression and potential therapeutic targets for invasive esophageal carcinomas.",Molecular cancer
12,Paper-Based Strip for Ultrasensitive Detection of OSCC-Associated Salivary MicroRNA via CRISPR/Cas12a Coupling with IS-Primer Amplification Reaction.,"As the most common malignancy in humans, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) not only harms the people's health but also undermines their confidence after facial surgery. Early detection and treatment can effectively reduce these damages. The unique collateral trans-cleavage nuclease activity of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas12a system was utilized to realize the detection of nucleic acid with high sensitivity. So, in this work, we designed a point-of-care testing (POCT) platform for the detection of OSCC-associated salivary hsa-miRNA 31-5p (miR-31) via the cascade signal amplification of ""invading stacking primer"" (IS-primer) amplification reaction (ISAR), CRISPR/Cas12a, and dual-mode paper-based strip (dm-Strip). To amplify the detection signal of trace miR-31, the cascade signal amplification of CRISPR/Cas12a system coupling with ISAR was designed in a one-pot reaction at a constant temperature. The target miR-31 could activate the ISAR to generate numerous DNAs, which would further trigger the trans-cleavage effect of Cas12a to catalyze the nonspecific single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage. This ssDNA was labeled with digoxin and biotin at the 5' and 3' termini (digoxin/ssDNA/biotin), respectively, which led to generate the naked-eye signal and fluorescent signal of the designed dm-Strip. The whole detection time was 90 min with limit-of-detection (LOD) down to aM level. This ISAR/Cas12a-based dm-Strip (ISAR/Cas12a-dmStrip) allowed for the portable and ultrasensitive detection of miRNA, an important step in early diagnosis of OSCC and biomedical research.",Analytical chemistry

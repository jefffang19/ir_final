0,Exploiting salivary miR-31 as a clinical biomarker of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Background: Oral carcinoma is an important malignancy throughout the world. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed, non-coding RNAs that regulate post-transcriptional levels of targeted mRNAs. MiRNA-31(miR-31) is significantly upregulated in oral carcinoma tissues and plays oncogenic roles in oral carcinogenesis. Methods: We analyzed the levels of miR-31 in saliva of patients with oral carcinoma (n = 45), oral verrucous leukoplakia (n = 10), and control healthy individuals (n = 24) by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: Salivary miR-31 was significantly increased in patients with oral carcinoma at all clinical stages, including very small tumors. However, our preliminary analysis showed no increase of salivary miR-31 in patients with oral verrucous leukoplakia relative to controls. The miR-31 was more abundant in saliva than in plasma, suggesting salivary miR-31 was a more sensitive marker for oral malignancy. After excision of oral carcinoma, salivary miR-31 was remarkably reduced, indicating that most of the upregulated salivary miR-31 came from tumor tissues. Conclusion: Our results point to a potential application of salivary miR-31 as a biomarker for early detection and postoperative follow-up of oral carcinoma.",Head & neck
1,MiR-31-5p-ACOX1 Axis Enhances Tumorigenic Fitness in Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Via the Promigratory Prostaglandin E2.,"During neoplastic development, a multitude of changes in genome-encoded information are progressively selected to confer growth and survival advantages to tumor cells. microRNAs-mRNAs regulatory networks, given their role as a critical layer of robust gene expression control, are frequently altered in neoplasm. However, whether and how these gene perturbations impact metabolic homeostasis remains largely unresolved. Methods: Through targeted miRNA expression screening, we uncovered an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC)-associated miRNAome, among which miR-31-5p was identified based on extent of up-regulation, functional impact on OSCC cell migration and invasion, and direct regulation of the rate-limiting enzyme in peroxisomal Î²-oxidation, ACOX1. Results: We further found that both miR-31-5p and ACOX1 underpin, in an antagonistic manner, the overall cellular lipidome profiles as well as the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC cells. Interestingly, the extracellular levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key substrate of ACOX1, were controlled by the miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis, and were shown to positively influence the extent of cell motility in correlation with metastatic status. The promigratory effect of this metabolite was mediated by an elevation in EP1-ERK-MMP9 signaling. Of note, functional significance of this regulatory pathway was further corroborated by its clinicopathologically-correlated expression in OSCC patient specimens. Conclusions: Collectively, our findings outlined a model whereby misregulated miR-31-5p-ACOX1 axis in tumor alters lipid metabolomes, consequently eliciting an intracellular signaling change to enhance cell motility. Our clinical analysis also unveiled PGE2 as a viable salivary biomarker for prognosticating oral cancer progression, further underscoring the importance of lipid metabolism in tumorigenesis.",Theranostics
2,miR-31 targets ARID1A and enhances the oncogenicity and stemness of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"miR-31 is oncogenic for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Proteins containing the AT-rich interacting domain (ARID) modulate the accessibility of chromatin to the transcription machinery needed for gene expression. In this study, we showed that miR-31 was able to target ARID1A in HNSCC. HNSCC tumors had an inverse miR-31 and ARID1A expression. miR-31 associated oncogenicities were rescued by ARID1A expression in HNSCC cells. Furthermore, ARID1A repressed the stemness properties and transcriptional activity of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM via the protein's affinity for AT-rich sites within promoters. HNSCC patients with tumors having high level of miR-31 expression and high levels of Nanog/OCT4/Sox2/EpCAM expression, together with low level of ARID1A expression, were found to have the worst survival. This study provides novel mechanistic clues demonstrating that miR-31 inhibits ARID1A and that this enriches the oncogenicity and stemness of HNSCC.",Oncotarget
3,Prognostic markers in esophageal cancer: from basic research to clinical use.,"Esophageal cancer (EC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related death in Asian countries. Due to the biology of EC, including aggressive local invasion, early metastasis and drug resistance, EC has a low survival rate. Therefore, molecular markers for prognosis judgment are urgently required so as to identify subgroups of patients that will benefit from more aggressive therapeutic interventions. So far, many genes and miRNAs, such as VEGF, cyclin D1, and miR-21, have been shown to be valuable when predicting the prognosis of EC. Some circulating molecules, including miR-200c, miR-1246, miR-31, have been identified as the independent risk factors for poor survival. However, the function and mechanism of these molecules in EC remains unclear. More clinical studies should be performed to promote the clinical use of prognosis-related markers in the management of EC.",Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology
4,Upregulation of miR-31* is negatively associated with recurrent/newly formed oral leukoplakia.,"Background: Oral leukoplakia (OLK) is a potentially malignant disorder of the oral cavity. However, the underlying mechanism of OLK is still unclear. In this study, we explore possible miRNAs involved in OLK. Methodology/principal findings: Using miRNA microarrays, we profiled miRNA expression in OLK and malignantly transformed OLK (mtOLK) tissue samples. The upregulation of miR-31*, miR-142-5p, miR-33a, miR-1259, miR-146b-5p, miR-886-3p, miR-886-5p, miR-519d, and miR-301a along with the downregulation of miR-572, miR-611, miR-602, miR-675, miR-585, miR-623, miR-637, and miR-1184 in mtOLK were new observations. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses confirmed that miR-31* is highly expressed in mtOLK. There was a significant difference between the FISH score (p<0.05) in patients with or without recurrent/newly formed OLK. Functional analyses demonstrated that a miR-31* inhibitor decreased apoptosis in the Leuk-1, which is an immortalized oral epithelial cell line spontaneously derived from an oral leukoplakia lesion. miR-31* regulated apoptosis, cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in the HOIEC, which is a HPV E6/E7-immortalized oral epithelial cell line. Furthermore, miR-31* modulated the biological functions of apoptosis, cell proliferation, cell cycle, migration, and invasion in the oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line, Cal-27. Using bioinformatic analyses and dual luciferase reporter assays, we determined that the 3' untranslated region of fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) is the target of miR-31*. Expression of FGF3 was downregulated or upregulated in the presence of a miR-31* mimic or inhibitor, respectively. Conclusions/significance: Upregulation of miR-31* is negatively associated with recurrent/newly formed OLK. MiR-31* may exert similar but distinguishable effects on biological function in oral cells with different malignant potential. FGF3 is the target of miR-31*. miR-31* may play an important role during OLK progression through regulating FGF3. MiRNA* strands may also have prominent roles in oral carcinogenesis.",PloS one
5,Increase of microRNA miR-31 level in plasma could be a potential marker of oral cancer.,"Backgrounds: Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a worldwide disease. MicroRNAs are endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs that have important biological and pathological functions. miR-31 was found markedly up-regulated in OSCC and several other malignancies. However, miR-31 expression was also down-regulated in the metastasis process of breast carcinoma. Materials and methods: Using quantitative RT-PCR analysis, we identified plasma miR-31 in OSCC patients (n = 43) and case controlled individuals (n = 21). Nine OSCC patients saliva were also analyzed. The Mann-Whitney test and Wilcoxon matched pairs test were used to compare the differences among the various clinical variants. Results: miR-31 in plasma was significantly elevated in OSCC patients relative to age and sex-matched control individuals. This marker yielded a receiver operating characteristic curve area of 0.82 and an accuracy of 0.72 defined by leave-one-out cross-validation. In addition, the plasma miR-31 in patients was remarkably reduced after tumor resection suggesting that this marker is tumor associated. Our preliminary analysis also demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the increase of miR-31 in patient's saliva. Conclusion: This study concluded that plasma miR-31 could be validated a marker of OSCC for diagnostic uses.",Oral diseases
6,Co-targeting of multiple microRNAs on factor-Inhibiting hypoxia-Inducible factor gene for the pathogenesis of head and neck carcinomas.,"Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding RNAs that inhibit the expression of target genes that play roles in tumorigenesis. MiR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 are oncogenic miRNAs for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Factor-inhibiting hypoxia (FIH)-inducible factor is known to inactivate hypoxia-induced downstream effectors and is involved in HNSCC suppression. This study investigates whether miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 target FIH in HNSCC. Methods: Reporter assays, Western blot analysis, quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis, and phenotypic assays were used to prove that miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 directly target FIH. Clinicopathological implications of the gene expression were also analyzed. Results: MiR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 directly bind to various sites in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of FIH transcript, and this binding is associated with decreased FIH protein expression in HNSCC cells. Treatment with the precursors of these miRNAs increases the proliferation and migration of HNSCC cells. Concomitant treatment with precursors repressed FIH and enhanced oncogenicity most profoundly. Upregulation of miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 expression is found in more than 80% of HNSCC tumors and 72% of tumors have concordant upregulation of these 3 oncogenic miRNAs. The highest expression of these miRNAs is present in T4b and stage IVB tumors. Downregulation of FIH mRNA expression is noted in 69% of HNSCC tumors, and in tumors exhibiting high expression of these miRNAs, the FIH mRNA expression is consistently downregulated. Conclusion: This study provides novel clues indicating that miR-21, miR-31, and miR-184 co-target FIH tumor suppressor during pathogenesis in the vast majority of HNSCC.",Head & neck
7,Allelic imbalance in the miR-31 host gene locus in lung cancer--its potential role in carcinogenesis.,"Small non-protein coding RNA, microRNA (miR), which regulate messenger RNA levels, have recently been identified, and may play important roles in the pathogenesis of various diseases. The present study focused on miR-31 and investigated its potential involvement in lung carcinogenesis. The expression of miR-31 was altered in lung cancer cells through either the amplification or loss of the host gene locus. The strong expression of miR-31 in large cell carcinomas was attributed to the gene amplification. Meanwhile, the loss of miR-31 expression was more frequently observed in aggressive adenocarcinomas. Thus, miR-31 may play a pleiotropic role in the development of lung cancers among different histological types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show the potential causative mechanism of the altered expression of miR-31 and suggest its potentially diverse significance in the different histological types of lung cancers.",PloS one
8,"Ultraviolet radiation-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha, which is linked to the development of cutaneous SCC, modulates differential epidermal microRNAs expression.","Chronic exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is linked to the development of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a non-melanoma form of skin cancer that can metastasize. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±), a pro-inflammatory cytokine, is linked to UVR-induced development of SCC. To find clues about the mechanisms by which TNFÎ± may promote UVR-induced development of SCC, we investigated changes in the expression profiling of microRNAs (miRNA), a novel class of short noncoding RNAs, which affects translation and stability of mRNAs. In this experiment, TNFÎ± knockout (TNFÎ± KO) mice and their wild type (WT) littermates were exposed to acute UVR (2.0 kJ/m2) and the expression profiling of epidermal miRNA was determined 4hr post UVR exposure. TNFÎ± deletion in untreated WT mice resulted in differential expression (log fold change>1) of seventeen miRNA. UVR exposure in WT mice induced differential expression of 22 miRNA. However, UVR exposure in TNFÎ± KO mice altered only two miRNAs. Four miRNA, were differentially expressed between WT+UVR and TNFÎ± KO+UVR groups. Differentially expressed selected miRNAs were further validated using real time PCR. Few of the differentially expressed miRNAs (miR-31-5p, miR-196a-5p, miR-127-3p, miR-206-3p, miR-411-5p, miR-709, and miR-322-5p) were also observed in UVR-induced SCC. Finally, bio-informatics analysis using DIANA, MIRANDA, Target Scan, and miRDB algorithms revealed a link with major UVR-induced pathways (MAPK, PI3K-Akt, transcriptional mis-regulation, Wnt, and TGF-beta).",Oncotarget
9,Long noncoding RNA associated-competing endogenous RNAs in gastric cancer.,"Some long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression by acting as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). However, the roles of lncRNA associated-ceRNAs in oncogenesis are not fully understood. Here, based on lncRNA microarray data of gastric cancer, bioinformatic algorithm miRcode and microRNA (miRNA) targets database TarBase, we first constructed an lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network. Then, we confirmed it by data of six types of other cancer including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, papillary thyroid carcinoma, pituitary gonadotrope tumors, ovarian cancer, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. The results showed a clear cancer-associated ceRNA network. Eight lncRNAs (AC009499.1, GACAT1, GACAT3, H19, LINC00152, AP000288.2, FER1L4, and RP4-620F22.3) and nine miRNAs (miR-18a-5p, miR-18b-5p, miR-19a-3p, miR-20b-5p, miR-106a-5p, miR-106b-5p, miR-31-5p, miR-139-5p, and miR-195-5p) were involved. For instance, through its miRNA response elements (MREs) to compete for miR-106a-5p, lncRNA-FER1L4 regulates the expression of PTEN, RB1, RUNX1, VEGFA, CDKN1A, E2F1, HIPK3, IL-10, and PAK7. Furthermore, cellular experimental results indicated that FER1L4-small interfering RNA (siRNA) simultaneously suppressed FER1L4 and RB1 mRNA level. These results suggest that lncRNAs harbor MREs and play important roles in post-transcriptional regulation in cancer.",Scientific reports
10,"Comparison of microRNA profiles between benign and malignant salivary gland tumors in tissue, blood and saliva samples: a prospective, case-control study.","Introduction: Salivary gland tumors (SGTs) are rare head and neck malignancies consisting of a spectrum of tumors with different biological behaviors. Objective: In this study we aimed to find out differential expression of microRNA profiles between benign and malignant SGTs. Methods: We investigated the possible role of 95 microRNAs in the 20 patients with salivary gland tumors with comparison of 17 patients without malignancy or salivary gland diseases. Sixteen of the tumors were benign (seven pleomorphic adenomas, nine Warthin tumors), four of them were malignant (two squamous cell carcinomas, one high grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, one adenocarcinoma). Serum and saliva samples were collected from both patients and control group. Tissue samples of tumor masses were also collected from patient group. Results: Among studied microRNAs miR-21, miR-23a, miR-27a, miR-223, miR-125b, miR-126, miR-146a, miR-30e were down regulated in the benign group compared to control group in the serum samples (p-values are 0.04, 0.00005, 0.00005, 0.0022, 0.031, 0.00008, 0.044, and 0.0007, respectively). When tissue samples were studied miR-21, miR-31, miR-199a-5p, miR-146b, miR-345 were up-regulated in the malignant group compared to benign group (p values are 0.006, 0.02, 0.013, 0.013, 0.041, respectively). miR-30e showed statistically significant up-regulation in malignant tumor group's plasma samples compared to benign group (p=0.034). There was no statistically significant difference in saliva samples between groups. Conclusion: Our results showed that different microRNAs may play role in salivary tumor pathogenesis according to biological behavior. Although there was no difference in saliva samples between groups, according to tissue and serum samples miR-21 and 30e may have an important role; since they were down-regulated in benign tumors whereas up-regulated in malignant ones.",Brazilian journal of otorhinolaryngology
11,Screening of microRNA in patients with esophageal cancer at same tumor node metastasis stage with different prognoses.,"Patients at the same pathological stage of esophageal cancer (EC) that received the same surgical therapy by the same surgeon may have distinct prognoses. The current study aimed to explore the possibility of differentially- expressed microRNAs (miRNAs) underlying this phenomenon. Samples were collected from EC patients at the same tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage but with different prognoses. Paracancerous normal tissues were taken as controls. The specimens were histopathologically analyzed. Differentially-expressed miRNAs were analyzed using real-time quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Compared with patients with poor prognosis, those with good prognosis exhibited 88 two-fold or more than two-fold increased miRNA fragments and 4 half-decreased miRNAs. The most noticeably up-regulated miRNAs included hsa-miR-31, hsa-miR- 196b, hsa-miR-652, hsa-miR-125a-5p, hsa-miR-146b, hsa-miR-200c, hsa-miR-23b, hsa-miR-29a, hsa-miR-186, hsa-miR-205, hsa-miR-376a, hsa-miR-410, hsa-miR-532-3p, and hsa-miR-598, whereas the most significantly- downregulated miRNAs were hsa-let-7e, hsa-miR-130b, and hsa-miR-103. EC patients at same TNM stage but with different prognoses show differentially-expressed miRNAs.",Asian Pacific journal of cancer prevention : APJCP
